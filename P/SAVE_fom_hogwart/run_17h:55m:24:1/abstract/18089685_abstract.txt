A retrospective analysis of the long-term outcome of patients with membranous lupus nephropathy (MLN) was conducted. One hundred Chinese patients, 90 females and 10 males with a mean age of 32+/-9 years, with systemic lupus erythematosus and biopsy-proven MLN (ISN/RPS2003 classification criteria) were enrolled in this study. The patient and renal survivals were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the risk factors associated with end-stage renal failure (ESRF) were assessed by the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. The mean follow-up of all patients was 77.6+/-56 months. During follow-up, two patients died. Patient survival at 5 and 10 years was 98%. Renal survival at 5 and 10 years was 96.1% and 92.7%, respectively. Severe tubular-intersticial lesion (HR 66.514), nephrotic range proteinuria (HR 19.159) and refractoriness to treatments (HR 9.834) were independent risk factors for developing ESRF. Three of the six patients with ESRF had severe tubular-interstitial lesions on initial biopsy. Twenty-one patients underwent a repeat biopsy after 33months' (median time) follow-up, eight (38.1%) of these (class V superimposed class IV in 5, class V superimposed class III in 2 and class VI in 1) had transformed and three (37.5%) of them progressed to ESRF. Complications included infection (13%), thrombosis (3%), avascular necrosis (3%), diabetes mellitus (4%) and skin cancer (1%). The rate of patient and renal survival was high in this group of patients with MLN.
