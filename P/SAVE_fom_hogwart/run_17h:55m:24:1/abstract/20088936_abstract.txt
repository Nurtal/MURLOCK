A clinical subtype of purely obstetrical antiphospholipid antibody (aPL-Ab) syndrome (APS) requires three or more unexplained consecutive embryonic losses before the 10th week of gestation associated with persistently positive lupus anticoagulant (LAC), and/or anticardiolipin IgG or IgM, and/or anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (abeta2GpI) IgG or IgM. Although this diagnostic classification of APS appeared to be the most sensitive, the APS-associated serological criteria are still debated.
