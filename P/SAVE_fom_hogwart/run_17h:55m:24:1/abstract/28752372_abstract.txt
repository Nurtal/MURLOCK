Systemic lupus erythematosus is a complex autoimmune disease with a wide spectrum of clinical and immunopathological features. Cutaneous and articular manifestations are the most common signs in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. We here review the pathogenesis and the new classification of cutaneous lupus erythemathosus with a discussion of the significance of the various cutaneous signs. The lesions are classified according to the level of the cellular infiltrate and tissue damage in the epidermis, dermis, and/or subcutis. Furthermore, cutaneous lesions pointing to the presence of a thrombotic vasculopathy and those due to a distinct inflammatory, neutrophilic-mediated reaction pattern are highlighted. Particular attention will be given in describing the histology of skin manifestation. Treatment options for cutaneous lupus erythemathosus have increased with the introduction of new biological therapies. However, the majority of the patients still benefit from antimalarials, which remain the cornerstone of treatment. The evaluation and management of cutaneous lupus erythemathosus patients depend on the clinical findings and associated symptoms.
