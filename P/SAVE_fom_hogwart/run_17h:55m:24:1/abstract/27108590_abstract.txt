Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive inflammatory disease. Although the etiology and pathogenesis of RA are not known well, genetic and environmental factors are proposed to initiate an autoimmune process. We aimed to investigate mRNA expression levels of Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2), TLR-4, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) genes in RA disease. This study was conducted with 50 patients who were diagnosed with RA according to the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for RA and 50 age-matched healthy control individuals who did not have any joint diseases and autoimmune diseases. We collected whole blood from all participants and analyzed expression of TLR-2, TLR-4, and IL-6 genes at mRNA level using real-time qPCR. TLR-2 expression was detected to increase 3.8-fold and IL-6 expression was detected to increase 6.8-fold in RA patients compared to healthy controls. No difference was found between patient and control groups with regard to TLR-4 expression. Overexpression of TLR-2 and IL-6 may be responsible for RA pathogenesis. Inhibition of both TLR and IL signaling pathways may prevent joint inflammation and destruction.
