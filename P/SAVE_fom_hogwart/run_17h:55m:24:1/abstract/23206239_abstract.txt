Recent publications have proposed revisions to disease classification criteria, new definitions of remission, and guidelines for implementing treat-to-target strategies for the management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Despite developments leading to this practice-changing approach, the concept of treat to target has not yet been widely accepted or implemented in managed care. At the 24th Annual Meeting Expo of the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP), held in San Francisco on April 18, 2012, a 4-hour activity titled Incorporating New Treat-to-Target Guidance and Strategies in RA: What Managed Care Needs to Know was conducted in association with AMCP's Continuing Professional Education Partner Program. The practicum featured didactic presentations, a roundtable session, and an expert panel discussion detailing research evidence, ideas, and discussion topics central to the treat-to target concept in RA and its applications to managed care.
