The painDETECT questionnaire (PDQ) is a mechanism-based pain classification tool assigning patients to one of three categories depending on the quality of the experienced pain. Patients with non-nociceptive pain score high on the PDQ. The objective was to assess the proportions of the three PDQ classification groups in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to explore differences in clinical characteristics.
