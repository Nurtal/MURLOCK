Adiponectin plays an important role in the development of immune-mediated diseases. Currently published data regarding the relationship between serum/plasma levels of adiponectin and immune-mediated diseases are inconsistent. We therefore conducted this meta-analysis to explore the association of serum/plasma adiponectin levels with immune-mediated diseases in humans. Systematic literature search was conducted to identify all relevant studies. The study quality was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Pooled standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by random-effect model analysis. A total of 47 studies were included in our meta-analysis, including 27 studies of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), 9 studies of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 7 studies of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and 4 studies of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The results revealed significant differences in serum/plasma levels of adiponectin between immune-mediated diseases and normal controls (SMD = 1.262, 95% CI 0.766-1.758, p < 0.001). In the subgroup analysis stratified by disease type, the serum/plasma levels of adiponectin in T1DM, RA and SLE patients were higher than those in normal control, but not in AS patients. Moreover, in the subgroup analysis stratified by gender, in both men and women group, the serum/plasma levels of adiponectin in patients with immune-mediated diseases were higher than that in the control group. Furthermore, subgroup analyses also showed that immune-mediated diseases from Asian population, Caucasian population, mean age >40 years, and BMI ≥24 kg/m2 had higher serum/plasma adiponectin levels when compared with normal controls. Collectively, this meta-analysis demonstrates that serum/plasma levels of adiponectin in T1DM, RA and SLE patients were higher than those in normal controls, but not in AS patients.
