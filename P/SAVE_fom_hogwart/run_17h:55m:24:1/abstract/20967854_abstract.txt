New criteria to classify rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been derived in order to increase the specificity and sensitivity for early RA compared with the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in classification between the 1987 ACR criteria and the 2010 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria in an early arthritis cohort and to determine the test characteristics of the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria.
