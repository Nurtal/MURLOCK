Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a heterogeneous disease with unknown etiology. Here we aimed to distinguish RA subtypes based on peripheral blood (PB) gene expression profiles in comparison with a pathogen-response transcriptional program. PB was obtained from 35 RA patients and 15 healthy individuals. For expression profiling we used DNA microarrays. A combined cluster analysis of RA and control samples together with samples from a viral infection model revealed that the gene expression profile of a subgroup of RA patients (RA(A)) was reminiscent to that of poxvirus-infected macaques. Statistical analysis, followed by Gene Ontology analysis of the RA(A) patients confirmed that these patients form a distinct group, with activation of several host defense mechanisms that resemble a common host-pathogen response. Analysis of the promoter region of genes that were overexpressed in the RA(A) patients, revealed an enrichment of transcription factor binding sites for NF kappaB and interferon-activated transcription factors. Moreover, this subgroup of RA patients expressed significantly increased titers of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies. We conclude that activation of a host-pathogen response defines a subgroup of RA patients characterized by increased autoreactivity against citrullinated proteins.
