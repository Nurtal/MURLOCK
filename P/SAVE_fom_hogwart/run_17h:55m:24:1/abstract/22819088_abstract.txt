Classification criteria are created in an attempt to produce a homogenous group of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who can be used for clinical and basic research. The 1987 revised criteria lead to improved performance and more confidence in correct classification compared with the 1958 criteria. As therapies were introduced and early, aggressive approaches to RA management became common, there was a growing need for clinical trials focusing on early RA. The 2010 criteria were created to facilitate study of subjects at earlier stages in the disease. This article reviews the diagnostic performance of the 2010 criteria.
