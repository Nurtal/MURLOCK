For the first time in more than 50 years, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved a drug specifically for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This drug, belimumab (Benlysta), is a human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the B-cell survival factor, B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS). The approval of belimumab combined a pioneering approach to genomics-based gene discovery, an astute appreciation of translational medicine, a disciplined clinical strategy, a willingness to take calculated risks, a devoted cadre of patients and physicians and a healthy dose of serendipity. Collectively, these efforts have provided a model for the development of a new generation of drugs to treat the broad manifestations of SLE. However, as a substantial percentage of SLE patients do not respond to belimumab, further research is needed to better characterize the pathogenetic mechanisms of SLE, identify additional therapeutic targets, and develop effective and nontoxic novel agents against these targets.
