Lupus nephritis (LN) remains a major cause of ESRD and is associated with a >4-fold increase in mortality and significant morbidity in patients with lupus. The treatment of LN has evolved significantly over the past decade due to data from well conducted randomized controlled trials. We are currently in an era in which effective regimens exist in the form of induction and maintenance agents. Histopathologic classification of LN remains one of the main factors guiding therapy.
