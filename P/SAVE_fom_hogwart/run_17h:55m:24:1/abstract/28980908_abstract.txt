Despite the well-established value of currently used classification criteria for the early diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) there is a constant demand for novel biomarkers notably in autoantibody-negative patients. Interleukin 7 (IL-7) has been reported as a candidate diagnostic biomarker based on ACR-1987 criteria. However, clinical practice has moved to using the EULAR 2010 classification criteria. Therefore, to advance the use of IL-7 alongside the RA biomarker pipeline, we repeated the original study in a new cohort.
