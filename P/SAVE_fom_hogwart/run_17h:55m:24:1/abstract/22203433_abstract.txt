There have been enormous strides in our understanding of autoimmunity. These strides have come under the umbrellas of epidemiology, immunological phenotype and function, disease definitions and classification and especially new therapeutic reagents. However, while these advances have been herculean, there remains enormous voids. Some of these voids include genetic susceptibility and the interaction of genes and environment. The voids include induction of tolerance in preclinical disease and definitions of host susceptibility and responses to the expensive biologic agents. The voids include the so-called clustering of human autoimmune diseases and the issues of whether the incidence is rising in our western society. Other voids include the relationships between microbiology, vaccination, gut flora, overzealous use of antibiotics, and the role of nanoparticles and environmental pollution in either the induction or the natural history of disease. One cannot even begin to address even a fraction of these issues. However, in this special issue, we are attempting to discuss clinical issues in autoimmunity that are not usually found in generic reviews. The goal is to bring to the readership provocative articles that ultimately will lead to improvement in patient care.
