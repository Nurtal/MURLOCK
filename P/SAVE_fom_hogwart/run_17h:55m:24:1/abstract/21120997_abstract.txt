Neutrophil accumulation is balanced by both cell infiltration and cell clearance, the controls of which are pivotal in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other chronic inflammatory diseases. Of the neutrophil-specific proteases, matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP-8; also known as neutrophil collagenase or collagenase 2) is traditionally viewed as being crucial for collagen degradation and hence cell migration and infiltration. This study was undertaken to examine the role of MMP-8 in a murine model of spontaneous RA.
