Vascular changes in lupus nephritis (LN) may be the cause of renal function derangement without obvious changes in activity or chronicity indices. Although a few morphological studies of renal vasculature exist, arteriolar morphometric parameters in LN have not been evaluated. For this study, 40 patients with LN and 40 age-matched patients with minimal change disease (controls) were included. Their clinical features were noted, renal biopsy changes classified according to the modified World Health Organization classification of LN and activity and chronicity indices were calculated. Arteriolar morphometric parameters were obtained using manual tracing and an image analysis software. Appropriate statistical tests were applied to assess significance of difference between various groups. Arteriolar wall thickness as well as circumference was significantly higher in all classes of LN as compared with controls (P <0.05). However, no difference was observed in the wall-to-lumen ratio between the two groups (P >0.05). An inter-class analysis of LN did not show any significant difference for any of the arteriolar morphometric parameters (P >0.05). No correlation was found between activity or chronicity indices and the various arteriolar morphometric parameters. This study demonstrates morphometric evidence of arteriolar wall changes in LN. Although no correlation was found with the histological features, further studies are required in this area.
