Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe autoimmune connective tissue disease. Our current knowledge about the serum proteome, or serum biomarker panels, reflecting disease and disease status is still very limited. Affinity proteomics, represented by recombinant antibody arrays, is a novel, multiplex technology for high-throughput protein expression profiling of crude serum proteomes in a highly specific, sensitive, and miniaturized manner. The antibodies are deposited one by one in an ordered pattern, an array, onto a solid support. Next, the sample is added, and any specifically bound proteins are detected and quantified. The binding pattern is then converted into a relative protein expression map, or protein map, deciphering the composition of the sample at the molecular level. The methodology provides unique opportunities for delineating serum biomarkers reflecting SLE, thus paving the way for improved diagnosis, classification, and prognosis.
