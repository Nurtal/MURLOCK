Isogarcinol is a new immunosuppressant that we extracted from Garcinia mangostana L. In the present study, we elucidate its beneficial effect in chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) in mice -- a model for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in human. The oral administration of 60 mg/kg isogarcinol significantly reduced proteinuria, corrected the abnormal serum biochemical indicator, and decreased the amount of serum antibodies and lowered the renal histopathology score. In addition, isogarcinol alleviated the abnormal activation of CD4 T cells and decreased the expression of inflammatory genes and cytokines in the kidneys and peritoneal macrophages. The mechanism of action of isogarcinol is associated with downregulation of CD4 T cells and inflammatory effects. Therefore, we believe that isogarcinol may be a potential therapeutic drug candidate for future treatment of SLE.
