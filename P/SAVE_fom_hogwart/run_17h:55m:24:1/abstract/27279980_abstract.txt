Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multi-factorial autoimmune disease which may be characterized by T lymphocytes dysfunctions. Th17 cells have been identified as new effector cells, which play an important role in the pathogenesis. In recent years, immunomodulatory effect of vitamin D3 has been noticed. In the present experiment, the effect of vitamin D3 on the expression of IL-17, IL-23, IL-4 and IFN-Î³ were assessed in activated chromatin-induced mouse model for SLE.
