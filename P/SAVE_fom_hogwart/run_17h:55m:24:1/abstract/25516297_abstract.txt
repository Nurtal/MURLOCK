Human IL12RB1 encodes IL12RÎ²1, a type I transmembrane receptor that is an essential component of the IL12- and IL23-signaling complex. IL12RB1 is well-established as being a promoter of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH), the immunological reaction that limits tuberculosis. However, recent data demonstrate that in addition to promoting DTH, IL12RB1 also promotes autoimmunity. The contradictory roles of IL12RB1 in human health raises the question, what are the factors governing IL12RB1 function in a given individual, and how is inter-individual variability in IL12RB1 function introduced? Here we review recent data that demonstrate individual variability in IL12RB1 function is introduced at the epigenetic, genomic polymorphism, and mRNA splicing levels. Where and how these differences contribute to disease susceptibility and outcome are also reviewed. Collectively, recent data support a model wherein IL12RB1 sequence variability - whether introduced at the genomic or post-transcriptional level - contributes to disease, and that human IL12RB1 is not as simple a gene as we once believed.
