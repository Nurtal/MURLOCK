There have been numerous recent advances in our understanding about the epidemiology, pathophysiology, classification, assessment, and emerging treatments and treatment paradigms of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA). This review provides an update on classification, assessment approaches, and treatments for these conditions. This is timely because it is becoming clear that the prevalence of the spondyloarthritides, including PsA, ankylosing spondylitis, and the broader categories of SpA may be present in 1-2% of the general population, more prevalent than rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
