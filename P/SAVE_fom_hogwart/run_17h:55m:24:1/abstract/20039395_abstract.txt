In the sanroque mouse model of lupus, pathologic germinal centers (GCs) arise due to increased numbers of follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, resulting in high-affinity anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies that cause end-organ inflammation, such as glomerulonephritis. The purpose of this study was to examine the hypothesis that this pathway could account for a subset of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
