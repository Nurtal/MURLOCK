Because symptoms are not immediately visible to others, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is often considered an invisible illness. This invisibility can reduce the social support received from network members and adversely affect the quality of life. In the light of this, social support from formal support groups and from medical professionals can be particularly important; however, literature examining support from these sources is scarce. The purpose of this study was to explore the nature and impact of social support from medical professionals and from support groups for individuals with SLE.
