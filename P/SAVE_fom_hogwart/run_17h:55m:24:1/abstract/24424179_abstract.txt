Diabetes mellitus is increasing in prevalence worldwide. The economic costs and burden of the disease are considerable given the cardiovascular complications and co-morbidities that it may entail. Two major groups of diabetes mellitus have been defined, type 1, or immune-based, and type 2. In recent years, other subgroups have been described in-between these major groups. Correct classification of the disease is crucial in order to ascribe the most efficient preventive, diagnostic and treatment strategies for each patient. In the present review, we discuss the epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, diagnostic criteria and clinical classification of what is currently known as autoimmune diabetes. In addition, the other groups of diabetes mellitus will be regarded in relation to their pathogenesis and potential autoimmunity features.
