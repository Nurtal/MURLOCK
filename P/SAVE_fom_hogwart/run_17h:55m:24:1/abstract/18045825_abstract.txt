The International Society of Nephrology/ Renal Pathology Society classification (ISN/RPS) of lupus glomerulonephritis (GN) divides diffuse GN (>/=50% involvement) into diffuse segmental (IV-S) and diffuse global GN (IV-G). This division tests whether the pathogenesis and clinical outcomes are the same as when similar patients are classified using the World Health Organization (WHO) classification into severe segmental (WHO III >/=50%) and diffuse global (WHO-IV) GN.
