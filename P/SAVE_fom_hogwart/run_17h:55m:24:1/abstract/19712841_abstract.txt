Kidney involvement is common in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Its clinical presentations are highly variable, ranging from mild asymptomatic proteinuria and/or hematuria to rapidly progressive uremia. Histological evidence of lupus nephritis is present in most patients with SLE, even when they do not yet have clinical manifestations. Current classification ISN/RPS 2003 (International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society) of lupus nephritis was promoted by a widely perceived need to re-examine existing classification, provide clearer distinctions between the histological classes, and improve diagnostic reproducibility and interobserver agreement. Lupus nephritis is a serious disease whose prognosis can usually be improved dramatically by treatment, but treatment is potentially toxic, prolonged, and complex. Current treatment regimens combine corticosteroids with cyclophosphamide, azathioprine or ciclosporin; mycophenolate mofetil has received much recent attention as a potentially immune suppressive agent and less aggressive immunosuppressive regimens can be prescribed. SLE patients should be regular followed to detect early kidney involvement.
