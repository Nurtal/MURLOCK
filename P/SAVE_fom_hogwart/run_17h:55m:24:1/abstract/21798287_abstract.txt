IL-17 plays important roles in synovial inflammation and bone destruction in the mouse model of autoimmune arthritis and in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Cadherin-11 determines the behavior of synovial cells in their proinflammatory and destructive tissue response in inflammatory arthritis, and promotes the invasive behavior of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of IL-17 on the expression of cadherin-11 in autoimmune experimental arthritis and in RA synovium. The severity of synovial inflammation and bone destruction were examined in IL-17-injected knee joints of mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Cadherin-11 expression was examined in the synovium of mice with CIA, of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra)-deficient mice and of patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA). Cadherin-11 expression was also examined in the synovium of IL-17 injected knee joints from CIA mice and in IL-17-stimulated FLS of CIA mice and RA patients. IL-17 aggravated synovial inflammation and bone destruction in CIA. By immunohistochemistry, cadherin-11 expression was increased in the synovium of mice with CIA and IL-1Ra-deficient mice and in patients with RA. Synovial cadherin-11 expression in IL-17-injected knee joints, measured by real-time RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry, was increased in CIA. Cadherin-11 expression was significantly increased by IL-17 in cultured FLS of CIA mice and RA patients, and these increases were blocked by NF-ÎºB inhibitors. IL-17 increased the expression of cadherin-11 in vivo and in vitro, which implies that an IL-17-induced increase of cadherin-11 is involved in IL-17-induced aggravation of joint destruction and inflammation.
