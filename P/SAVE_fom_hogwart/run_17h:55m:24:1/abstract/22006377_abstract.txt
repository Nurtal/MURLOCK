Autoantibody immune complexes and cellular infiltrates drive nephritis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and in murine lupus. The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is assumed to promote cellular infiltration of inflamed tissues. Moreover, CXCR3 deficiency ameliorates lupus nephritis in the MRL/MpJ-Fas(lpr) (MRL/lpr) mouse model of SLE. Hence, CXCR3 blockade has been suggested as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of lupus nephritis. We undertook this study to test the effect of CXCR3 in the (NZB Ã— NZW)F(1) (NZB/NZW) mouse model of SLE.
