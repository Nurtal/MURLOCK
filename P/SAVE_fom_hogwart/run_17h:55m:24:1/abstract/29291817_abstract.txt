The 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics criteria propose the classification of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) by biopsy-confirmed lupus nephritis plus circulating antinuclear antibody or anti-double-stranded DNA antibody. Application of this stand-alone renal criterion to a cohort of patients with "full-house" glomerular deposits resulted in mistaken classification of SLE in some cases with antinuclear antibody. More precise biopsy criteria using a constellation of characteristic features are needed to optimize the kidney biopsy standard for lupus nephritis.
