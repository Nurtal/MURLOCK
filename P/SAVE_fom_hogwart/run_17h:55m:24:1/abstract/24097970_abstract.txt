The International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) pathological classification criteria of lupus nephritis are limited to glomerular injury. Although the tubulointerstitium is commonly involved, the importance of such involvement is not well defined. The major objective of this study was to evaluate the association of interstitial inflammation with the long-term outcomes of patients with lupus nephritis.
