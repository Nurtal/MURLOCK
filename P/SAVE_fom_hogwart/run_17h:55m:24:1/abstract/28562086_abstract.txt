Current research on antimalarial protein kinases has provided an opportunity to design kinase-based antimalarial drugs. We have developed a common feature-based pharmacophore model from a set of multiple chemical scaffolds including derivatives of 3,6-imidazopyridazines, pyrazolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines and imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazines, in order to incorporate the maximum structural diversity information in the model for the Plasmodium falciparum calcium-dependent protein kinase-1 (PfCDPK-1) target. The best pharmacophore model (Hypo-1) with the essential features of two hydrogen bond donors (HBD), one hydrophobic aromatic (HYAr) and one ring aromatic (RA) showed the classification accuracies of 86.27%, 78.43% and 100.00% in labelling the training and test set (test set-1 and test set-2) compounds into more active and less active classes. In order to identify the crucial interaction between multiple scaffold ligands and the target protein, we first developed the homology model using a template structure of P. bergheii (PbCDPK1; PDB ID: 3Q5I), and thereafter performed the docking studies. The residues such as Lys85, Phe147, Tyr148, Leu198, Val211, and Asp212 were found to be the most important interacting residues for possessing PfCDPK-1 inhibitory activity.
