The present study aimed to identify the genes involved in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Arabs by investigating a panel of 84 genes related to the t helper (Th)17-related regulatory network and to further explore the expression levels of serum interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-17F in a studied cohort. A comparative analysis of gene expression profile in SLE and lupus nephritis (LN) patients against that of healthy controls (HC) was performed.
