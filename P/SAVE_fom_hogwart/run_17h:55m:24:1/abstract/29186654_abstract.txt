Pre-clinical and uncontrolled studies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) showed that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have a potential therapeutic role in refractory cases. The optimal therapeutic strategy in these patients remain to be elucidated. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that repeated administrations of 1×106/kg body weight of allogenic MSCs, that is a significantly lower dosage with respect to the fixed 1×106 MSC used in animal models, can be effective in improving the clinical course of a murine SLE model.
