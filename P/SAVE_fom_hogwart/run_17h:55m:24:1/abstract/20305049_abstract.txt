This study sought to examine the long-term outcomes of transtrochanteric anterior rotational osteotomy (ARO) as treatment for osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Twenty-one patients (33 hips), aged 20-40 years, underwent ARO between 1980 and 1988. We examined 16 patients (25 hips), a 76% follow-up rate. A Kaplan-Meier curve was used for survivorship analysis. Patients with surviving hips were evaluated by the modified Oxford hip score and Short Form 36 (SF-36). Twelve hips in eight patients had survived at the final follow-up. The average length of hip survival was 24.6 years (range: 20.1-27.2 years). Three patients (six hips) had died of unrelated causes without any subsequent operation. Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis with the endpoint defined as the need for a subsequent operation, the hip survival rate at 25 years was 73.7% (95% confidence interval, +/-19.8%). Based on classification by the modified Oxford hip score, five hips were classified as excellent, two hips were good, and the remaining five hips were fair. The average SF-36 summary score for the physical and mental components was 38.7 and 47.2 points, respectively. The physical component summary scores for three patients exceeded the normal level of the Japanese population. Lupus (2010) 19, 860-865.
