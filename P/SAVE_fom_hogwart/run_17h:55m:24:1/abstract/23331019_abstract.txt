A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) is overexpressed in many cancers such as colorectal, gastric and liver. Silence APRIL gene or neutralize its expression may serve as therapeutic strategies to manage those cancers. Current phase I clinical trial shows that heavily pretreated patients were well tolerated high dose intravenous infusion. Herein, we report a humanized antibody (Ab) that neutralizes APRIL protein and inhibits cancer cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. The Ab was generated through conjugating foreign immunodominant T-helper cell (Th) epitopes to the N- or C-terminal of four soluble APRIL mutants. In vitro anti-proliferation effects were evaluated in both Raji and Jurkat cell lines. In vivo inhibition of tumor growth was determined in a tumor xenograft animal model with green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive Raji cell line. In vitro data demonstrated that this Ab significantly inhibited both Raji and Jurkat cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The molecular imaging data demonstrated in vivo tumor growth delay when animals were treated with Ab. In conclusion, we have developed a humanized anti-APRIL Ab, which is effective in inhibiting tumor cell proliferations both in vitro and vivo. The humanized Ab has potential to reduce the immunoresponse in the clinical situation. This Ab also can be used in other APRIL mediated diseases such as Sjogren syndrome, multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus.
