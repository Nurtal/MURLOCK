Hereby, we report the case of a 12-year-old girl developing oligoarthritis and progressing into a polyarticular form. Rheumatoid factor was positive, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) was diagnosed. After a poor response to DMARDs, an anti-TNF agent (infliximab) was initiated, but to be discontinued due to an allergic reaction. The same complication was observed with the fully human derivative, adalimumab. At the age of 22, the patient presented septicemia with severe anemia and subsequent development of leukopenia, myocarditis with heart failure, and ANA, aSm, aSS-A, aCL positives, and nephrotic syndrome. These new clinical manifestations fulfilled the classification criteria for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Due to the poor therapeutic responses for both diseases, alternative medical options have to be considered, such as targeted therapy with anti-CD20 or interleukin-6 receptor antagonist monoclonal antibodies. This patient may also be a candidate for autologous hemopoietic stem cell transplantation.
