Renal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is common and has been associated with an increased risk of mortality [1]. Early diagnosis is imperative to control proteinuria and prevent the progression to end-stage renal disease. Standard induction therapies include cyclophosphamide (CYC) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF); however, it has been estimated that approximately 30% of patients are refractory to these standard treatments after 1Â year [2]. We present two cases of patients diagnosed with lupus nephritis (LN) who demonstrated persistent proteinuria while on standard treatments that markedly improved after addition of thalidomide (THD). A literature review was performed indicating that THD use with prednisolone (PL) was more efficacious than MMF with PL in resolving lupus nephritis in a mouse model. Thalidomide, which was well tolerated, was associated with a reduction in the protein-to-creatinine ratio with sustained results in both of our patient cases. These cases suggest more clinical data is needed to explore the potential utility of thalidomide in the treatment of LN.
