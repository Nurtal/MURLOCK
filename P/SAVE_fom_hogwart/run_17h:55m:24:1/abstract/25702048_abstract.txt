Class III and IV are the most ominous among the classes of lupus nephritis (LN) and there are contradictory reports on whether LN class IV-G (global) differs from LN class IV-S (segmental) as envisaged by the International Society of Nephrology and the Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) 2003 classification. These subcategories are not validated for LN class III. This study was designed to assess the differences between global and segmental subclasses in classes III and IV of LN.
