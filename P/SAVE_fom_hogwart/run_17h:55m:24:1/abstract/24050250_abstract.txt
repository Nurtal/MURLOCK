Autoantibodies directed against ion channels and ionotropic receptors are associated with neuromuscular and neurological disorders. Their detection has proven to be useful for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of these autoimmune syndromes. We have designed an ion channel chip for the systematic and rapid screening of antibodies directed against tens of different ion channels. The chip has been validated by confirming the presence of autoantibodies in patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Such a chip will be useful for the diagnosis of already documented disorders, but also to identify new targets of autoimmunity and classification of the corresponding diseases. The article presents some promising patents on the Ion Channel Chip.
