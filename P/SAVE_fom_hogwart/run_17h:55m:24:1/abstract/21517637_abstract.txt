A significant percentage of patients presenting with undifferentiated arthritis (UA) will progress to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), while others will undergo spontaneous remission. Evidence supports the use of therapeutic intervention in patients with UA to delay or halt disease progression and its long-term consequences. However, there is first a need to screen patients with UA to identify those with a high probability of progressing to RA who would benefit from antirheumatic therapy. The 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism RA classification criteria were designed for this purpose. These criteria can aid clinicians in deciding when it is appropriate to initiate therapy in patients at risk of progressing to RA. These criteria can also have important implications in reducing the inappropriate and unnecessary use of antirheumatic agents in patients less likely to develop RA, thus reducing healthcare costs and minimizing the risk of sequelae associated with these agents. Use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologic agents in patients with UA has been associated with delays in disease progression. However, further clinical studies are needed to fully evaluate the long-term clinical and economic outcomes of these agents in patients with UA.
