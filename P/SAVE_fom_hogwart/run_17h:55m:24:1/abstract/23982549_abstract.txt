WHO classifications and newly introduced ISN/RPS classification are in use to identify the different morphological patterns of lupus nephritis. This study was carried out to learn in details the spectrum of histomorphology in lupus nephritis according to both WHO and ISN/RPS classifications. A total of 58 patients with histological diagnosis of lupus nephritis were included in the study. Renal biopsy samples were evaluated both by light microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy. Diffuse lupus nephritis was the most frequent histological class diagnosed (90%) along with common occurrence of hyaline thrombi, wire loop lesions, fibrinoid necrosis and crescents. No case of minimal glomerular lesion or advanced sclerosing lesion was found. The ISN/RPS classification was found to be more convenient to follow with its classes and definitions of diagnostic terms.
