Interferon-α (IFNα) is a primary pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and high IFNα levels may be associated with particular clinical manifestations. The prevalence of individual clinical and serologic features differs significantly by ancestry. This study was undertaken to detect associations between clinical and serologic disease manifestations and serum IFNα activity in a large diverse SLE cohort, using multivariate and network analyses.
