This article series provides a literature review of the disease-specific probiotic strains, associated with cardiometabolic diseases and fatigue syndromes, studied in published clinical trials in humans and animals. This is not an exhaustive review. The table design allows for quick access to supportive data and will be helpful as a guide for both researchers and clinicians. The goal of the probiotics and disease series is to provide clinically useful tools. The first article (part 1) focused on mental health and neurological conditions and the second article (part 2) explored cultured and fermented foods that are commonly available in the United States. This third article (part 3) explores the relationship between bacterial strains and 2 of the most prevalent diseases we have in modern society: cardiometabolic disease and fatigue syndromes. Future articles will review conditions related to respiratory, ear, nose, and throat infections and infectious diseases; autoimmunity and dermatological conditions; cancer; and gastrointestinal and genitourinary, followed by an article focused on probiotic supplements. This literature review is specific to disease condition, probiotic classification, and individual strain.
