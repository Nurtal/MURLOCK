Serositis is one of both ACR and SLICC classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a common type of extra renal flare. However, little is known about clinical or immunological associations of pleurisy or pericarditis. The aim of this study is to analyze associates and predictors of pleurisy versus pericarditis in Caucasians and African Americans with SLE.
