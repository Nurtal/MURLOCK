In lupus erythematosus-prone mice, including the BXSB, NZW and NZB strains, telomeric regions of chromosome 1 (Chr.1) contain major glomerulonephritis susceptibility loci such as Bxs3, Sle1, and Nba2. To assess whether strain MRL, a model for lupus erythematosus, had glomerulonephritis susceptibility loci on Chr.1, we created B6.MRLc1(82-100) congenic mice carrying MRL/MpJ Chr.1 (82-100 cM) based on the C57BL/6 background and investigated renal pathology. From 6 months of age, B6.MRLc1 (82-100) showed the onset of diseases such as splenomegaly due to proliferation of CD3- or B220-positive cells, glomerular damage, and an increased serum anti-dsDNA antibody concentration, and these were earlier and severer in females. The score for glomerular damage was higher in B6.MRLc1(82-100) mice over 12 months old than in C57BL/6 or even in wild-type MRL/MpJ. Immune-complex depositions were demonstrated on glomerular basement membrane in B6.MRLc1(82-100) by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. For the percentage of IgG1-positive glomeruli, B6.MRLc1 (82-100) had significantly higher values than C57BL/6. In evaluations of clinical parameters, serum levels of blood urea nitrogen and the anti-dsDNA antibody in B6.MRLc1(82-100) were significantly higher than those in C57BL/6. In conclusion, B6.MRLc1(82-100) clearly developed autoimmune-mediated glomerulonephritis, and we demonstrated that MRL Chr.1 contained a novel glomerulonephritis susceptibility locus. We named this locus Mag (MRL autoimmune glomerulonephritis) and it provided new insights into the genetic basis and pathogenesis of lupus nephritis.
