Modulators of the over-activation of myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have an advantage in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study was designed to evaluate the effects of FC-99, a novel benzenediamine derivative, on TLR-induced activation of mDCs, and to assess the efficacy of FC-99 in a murine model of SLE. In vitro, FC-99 inhibited the phenotypic (CD40 and MHC-II) and functional activation (IL-12 and CXCL10) of mDCs induced by TLR ligands. In vivo, MRLlpr/lpr mice displayed renal diseases associated with increased levels of proteinuria and immunoglobulin, which were ameliorated by FC-99. Enhanced accumulation and activation of mDCs in lymphoid organs was also impaired by FC-99. Additionally, FC-99 inhibited the activation of IκB-α and upregulated the expression of TNFα-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that FC-99 modulates TLR-induced activation of mDCs and ameliorates lupus-like syndrome in MRLlpr/lpr mice. This effect is closely associated with the inhibition of IκB-α and upregulation of TNFAIP3.
