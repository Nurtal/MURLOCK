Anti-citrullinated peptides antibodies (ACPAs) have high specificity for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but their role in the pathophysiology is not fully established. The main genetic risk factor for RA, the shared epitope in major histocompatibility complex class II, is associated with ACPAs. Among certain non-human primates, 8% carry the shared epitope called H6 haplotype, and being similar to humans, are ideal candidates to study the role of ACPAs in RA. The goal of this study was to develop a macaque model of RA based on immunization against citrullinated peptides to generate an ACPA-mediated model of arthritis.
