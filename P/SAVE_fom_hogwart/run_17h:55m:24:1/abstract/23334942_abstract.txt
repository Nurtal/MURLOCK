The 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) refer to a possible use of ultrasound "for confirmation of the clinical findings." We undertook this study to determine the optimized definition of ultrasound-detected synovitis for the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria and to assess the impact of its use on the accuracy of RA classification.
