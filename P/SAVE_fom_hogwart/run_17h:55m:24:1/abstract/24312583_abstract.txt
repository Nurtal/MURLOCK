Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) commonly accredited as "the great imitator" is a highly complex disease involving multiple gene susceptibility with non-specific symptoms. Many experimental and computational approaches have been used to investigate the disease related candidate genes. But the limited knowledge of gene function and disease correlation and also lack of complete functional details about the majority of genes in susceptible locus, encumbrances the identification of SLE related candidate genes. In this paper, we have studied the human immunome network (undirected) using various graph theoretical centrality measures integrated with the gene ontology terms to predict the new candidate genes. As a result, we have identified 8 candidate genes, which may act as potential targets for SLE disease. We have also carried out the same analysis by replacing the human immunome network with human immunome signaling network (directed) and as an outcome we have obtained 5 candidate genes as potential targets for SLE disease. From the comparison study, we have found these two approaches are complementary in nature.
