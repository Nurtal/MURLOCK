Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a sexually dimorphic inflammatory autoimmune disease with both articular and extraarticular disease manifestations, including RA-associated interstitial lung disease. Low levels of testosterone have been linked to disease severity in men with RA, and supplemental testosterone has been shown to improve RA symptoms in both postmenopausal women and men with low levels of testosterone. The mechanisms by which sex and sex steroids affect the immune system and autoimmunity are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the protective effects of testicular-derived sex hormones on the development of joint and lung disease in an autoimmune mouse model.
