Previous studies informed an increased prevalence of cutaneous papillomavirus (cHPV) infection in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The main objective of our study was to evaluate factors associated with cHPV infection in patients with either rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or SLE, and to determine whether SLE itself is an independent risk factor for cHPV infection. We included 670 patients (in consecutive selection) in this cross-sectional study (550 with RA and 120 with SLE). All patients were evaluated by a dermatologist; patients with cHPV infection were selected as cases (63) and the other 607 patients were selected as controls. The prevalence of cHPV infection was increased 2.8-fold in SLE patients (20%) compared with RA patients (7.1%). When comparing cases with controls, bivariate analysis showed statistically significant differences for: age, having SLE, and treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). When all of the potential risk factors identified using bivariate analysis (age, having SLE, and MMF) were included into a multivariate model, independent risk factors for cHPV infection were: having SLE (odds ratio: 2.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-4.48) and MMF therapy (odds ratio: 2.91, 95% confidence interval: 1.18-7.14).
