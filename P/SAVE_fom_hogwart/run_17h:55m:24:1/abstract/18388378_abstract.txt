Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is a rare cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma classified in the World Health Organization-European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (WHO-EORTC) classification as a unique extranodal lymphoma with characteristic by T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement. We report here a case of SPTCL in a 22 year-old woman who had presented with variably sized multiple nodules on both her legs. Initial differential diagnoses considered were panniculitis and lupus panniculitis. The histopathology showed a predominantly subcutaneous lobular infiltrate with atypical lymphocytes, karyorrhexis and rimming of adipocytes by lymphoid cells. Immunohistochemistry showed CD4-, CD8+, CD56- T-cell phenotype. Although TCR rearrangement studies were not done, the above T-cell phenotype and sparing of epidermis and dermis suggested the possibility of an SPTCL alpha/beta type. The patient received five cycles of a cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) regimen which resulted in the regression in her skin lesions and constitutional symptoms.
