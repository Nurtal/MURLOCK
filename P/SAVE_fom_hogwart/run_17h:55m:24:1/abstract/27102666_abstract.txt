The adaptive immune response in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is influenced by an interaction between host genetics and environment, particularly the host microbiome. Association of the gut microbiota with various diseases has been reported, though the specific components of the microbiota that affect the host response leading to disease remain unknown. However, there is limited information on the role of gut microbiota in RA. In this study we aimed to define a microbial and metabolite profile that could predict disease status. In addition, we aimed to generate a humanized model of arthritis to confirm the RA-associated microbe.
