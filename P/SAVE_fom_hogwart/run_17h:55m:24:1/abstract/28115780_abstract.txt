Systemic sclerosis is a complex disease characterized by autoimmunity, vasculopathy and tissue fibrosis. Although most patients present with some degree of skin sclerosis, which is a distinguishing hallmark, the clinical presentation vary greatly complicating the diagnosis. In this regard, new classification criteria were jointly published in 2013 by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). A recent major development in the classification criteria is improved sensitivity, particularly for detecting early disease. The new criteria allow more cases to be classified as having systemic sclerosis (SSc), which leads to earlier treatment. Moreover it is clinically beneficial in preventing the disease progression with its irreversible fibrosis and organ damage. The aim of this review is to give insight into new classification criteria and current trends in the diagnosis of systemic sclerosis.
