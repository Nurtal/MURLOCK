This paper presents benchmarking results of human epithelial type 2 (HEp-2) interphase cell image classification methods on a very large dataset. The indirect immunofluorescence method applied on HEp-2 cells has been the gold standard to identify connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Sj√∂gren's syndrome. However, the method suffers from numerous issues such as being subjective, time consuming and labor intensive. This has been the main motivation for the development of various computer-aided diagnosis systems whose main task is to automatically classify a given cell image into one of the predefined classes.
