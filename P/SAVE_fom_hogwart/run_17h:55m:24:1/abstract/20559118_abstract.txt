Oral lesions are frequent complications of systemic lupus erythematosus, but only ulceration is included in the 1982 American College of Rheumatology revised criteria. Because the lack of a uniform classification, a range of ulcerative and keratotic lesions are typically described. In this report we describe a unique progressive irregularly cobblestoned and vegetating plaque of the oral mucosa with clinical and histological features mimicking a cutaneous lymphoma. Despite the papillomatous and extensive nature of the lesions and the dense lymphoid infiltrate with follicle formation suggesting a malignant lymphoproliferative process, the slow progression coupled with a mixed cell infiltrate and polyclonality supported a diagnosis of pseudolymphoma. Recognition of this entity is important to prevent diagnosing them as a malignant lymphoma. As well as with the other mucosal lesions in lupus erythematosus, this pseudolymphomatous variant should be added to the disease spectrum.
