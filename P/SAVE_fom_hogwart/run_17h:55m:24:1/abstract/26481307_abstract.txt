We have devised a method of using intracellular combinatorial libraries to select antibodies that control cell fates. Many agonist antibodies have been selected with this method, and the process appears to be limited only by the availability of a phenotypic selection system. We demonstrate the utility of this approach to discover agonist antibodies that engage an unanticipated target and regulate macrophage polarization by selective induction of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. This antibody was used therapeutically to block autoimmunity in a classic mouse model of spontaneous systemic lupus erythematosus.
