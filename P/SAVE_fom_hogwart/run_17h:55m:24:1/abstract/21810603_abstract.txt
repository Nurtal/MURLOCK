Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a human chronic inflammatory disease caused by the action of autoreactive T and B cells. Class I phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI3K) are enzymes that trigger formation of 3-poly-phosphoinositides that induce cell survival. Enhanced PI3K activation is a frequent event in human cancer. Nonetheless, in a genetic model with enhanced activation of class I(A) PI3K in T cells, mice show a greater tumor index but die of a lupus-like disease. In this study, we studied the potential PI3K involvement in human SLE. The PI3K pathway was frequently activated in SLE patient PBMC and T cells (∼70% of cases), more markedly in active disease phases. We examined the mechanism for PI3K pathway activation and found enhanced activation of PI3Kδ in SLE peripheral blood T cells. The magnitude of PI3K pathway activation in patients paralleled activated/memory T cell accumulation. We examined potential tolerance mechanisms affected by increased PI3K activity; SLE patients showed reduced activation-induced cell death of activated/memory T cells. Moreover, the defective activation-induced cell death in SLE T cells was corrected after reduction of PI3Kδ activity, suggesting that PI3Kδ contributes to induction of enhanced SLE memory T cell survival. These observations point to PI3Kδ as a target of clinical interest for SLE.
