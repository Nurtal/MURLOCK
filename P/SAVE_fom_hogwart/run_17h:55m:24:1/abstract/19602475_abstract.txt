The chemokine CXCL13, also known as BCA-1 (B-cell-attracting chemokine-1) or BLC (B-lymphocyte chemoattractant), is a major regulator of B-cell trafficking. We have recently shown that excessive expression of dendritic cell-derived CXCL13 is a distinctive early event for nephritis in a murine model of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Furthermore, in kidney biopsies from SLE patients, CXCL13 protein and mRNA are strongly expressed in B-cell-containing inflammatory lesions. Here, we ask whether serum levels of CXCL13 correlate with disease activity and renal involvement in SLE patients.
