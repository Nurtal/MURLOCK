IgA isotypes of anticardiolipin and anti-ß(2) glycoprotein I (anti-ß(2)-GPI) are omitted from the revised antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) classification criteria. Multiple studies have found a high prevalence of IgA anti-ß(2)-GPI in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We determined the frequency and associations of IgA anti-ß(2)-GPI in a cohort of patients with SLE.
