Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a heterogeneous disease. In rheumatology, researchers have not identified useful clinical markers to predict the effects of biological agents or of nonbiological, antirheumatic drugs before administration. Since the advent of biological agents, therapeutic strategies for RA have focused on early detection and early intensive treatment. Although responders to Japanese Oriental (Kampo) medicine exist, physicians first have had to diagnose RA using the practices of conventional medicine. They could identify those patients who would benefit from administration of Kampo medicine only by administering the treatment. Only the presence of a positive response could confirm the benefits for a particular individual. In this article, the author discusses the clinical importance of Kampo medicine within the context of the present RA classification criteria and therapeutic treatment and discusses the use of the basal value of anti-CCP antibody (aCCP) titer as a prognostic factor for use of Kampo medicine for RA. The author then defines a methodology for determining who should receive the treatment.
