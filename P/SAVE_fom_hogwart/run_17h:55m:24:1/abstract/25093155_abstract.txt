Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education: Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most dreadful complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is responsible for the major share of morbidity and mortality of this disease. Its diagnosis, classification and management have posed significant challenges to the nephrologists and pathologists over the past several decades. A series of WHO classifications of LN were followed by the development of the international society of nephrology/renal pathology society (ISN/RPS) classification of LN in 2003. The classification has largely succeeded in achieving its goals, but a few limitations have also been exposed. It is time to revisit the classification in the light of experience of validation studies and new emerging data on this disease.
