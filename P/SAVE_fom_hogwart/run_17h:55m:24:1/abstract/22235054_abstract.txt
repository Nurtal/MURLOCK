Adjuvants, commonly used in vaccines, may be responsible for inducing autoimmunity and autoimmune diseases, both in humans and mice. The so-called 'ASIA' (Autoimmune/inflammatory Syndrome Induced by Adjuvants) syndrome has been recently described, which is caused by the exposure to a component reproducing the effect of adjuvants. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in NZB/NZWF1 mice, a lupus-prone murine model. We injected 10 NZB/NZWF1 mice with CFA/PBS and 10 with PBS, three times, 3 weeks apart, and followed-up until natural death. CFA-injected mice developed both anti-double-stranded DNA and proteinuria earlier and at higher levels than the control group. Proteinuria-free survival rate and survival rate were significantly lower in CFA-treated mice than in the control mice (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively). Histological analyses showed a more severe glomerulonephritis in CFA-injected mice compared with the control mice. In addition, lymphoid hyperplasia in spleen and lungs, myocarditis, and vasculitis were observed in the former, but not in the latter group. In conclusion, the injection of CFA in NZB/NZWF1 mice accelerated autoimmune manifestations resembling 'ASIA' syndrome in humans.
