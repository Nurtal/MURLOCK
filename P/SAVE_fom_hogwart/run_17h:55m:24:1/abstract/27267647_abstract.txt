One of the main issues in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) patients is infection, such as tuberculosis (TB). Of note, SLE patients are susceptible to pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. However, to our knowledge, this contagious disease was rarely reported in pediatric lupus population, particularly diffuse or miliary TB. Therefore, from January 1983 to December 2011, 5,635 patients were followed-up at our Pediatric Rheumatology Unit and 285 (5%) of them met the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SLE.
