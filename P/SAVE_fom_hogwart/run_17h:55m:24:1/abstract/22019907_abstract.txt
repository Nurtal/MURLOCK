The confirmation of diagnosis of the Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) relies on laboratory tests. Current classification criteria for definite APS mandate the use of three "standardized" laboratory assays to detect antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) [viz: anticardiolipin (aCL) IgG and IgM, anti-β(2)glycoprotein I (anti-β(2)GPI) antibodies IgG and IgM and/or a lupus anticoagulant (LAC)], when at least one of the two major clinical manifestations (thrombosis or pregnancy losses) are present. Several attempts have been made to standardize the aCL and anti-β(2)GPI tests, though, a considerable degree of inconsistencies still exist, limiting the clinical and diagnostic value of aPL tests. Among the areas of concern are the type and source of calibrant material, the lack of proper validated reference material and of universal units of measurement, particularly for anti-β(2)GPI antibodies.
