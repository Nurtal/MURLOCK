The Fas gene polymorphisms -670A/G (rs1800682) and -1377G/A (rs2234767) have been shown to be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but findings are not consistent. To clarify this point, a meta-analysis was performed. We searched PubMed, CNKI, CBM and Wanfang database. Meta-odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were used to combine the data by fixed/random effects models based on heterogeneity test. The statistical analyses were conducted using Stata software. A total of seven studies involving 759 cases and 820 controls were considered in this study and ethnicity-specific meta-analysis was performed on Caucasian and Asian population. In overall population, meta-analysis revealed a trend toward to an association between SLE and Fas -670 A allele (OR = 1.310, 95 %CI = 1.028 ~ 1.670, P = 0.029). Similar results were detected in recessive model (OR = 1.626, 95 %CI = 1.104 ~ 2.395, P = 0.014) and in homozygous genotypic contrast (OR = 1.728, 95 %CI = 1.049 ~ 2.848, P = 0.032). Stratification by ethnicity indicated a significant association between SLE and the Fas -670A/G polymorphism in Asian population when allelic contrast (OR = 1.331, 95 %CI = 1.066 ~ 1.662, P = 0.011), homozygous genotypic contrast (OR = 1.848, 95 %CI = 1.164 ~ 2.932, P = 0.009) and dominant model were performed (OR = 1.542, 95 %CI = 1.045 ~ 2.275, P = 0.029). Meta-analysis of the Fas -1377G/A polymorphism indicated a significant association between SLE and the G allele in overall population (OR = 1.277, 95 %CI = 1.004 ~ 1.624, P = 0.046). The results from this meta-analysis provide evidence for the association between the Fas -670A/G and -1377G/A polymorphism and the risk of SLE. However, further studies are needed to draw a definitive conclusion.
