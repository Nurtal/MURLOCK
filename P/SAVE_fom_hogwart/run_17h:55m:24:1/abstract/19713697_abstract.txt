Antiphospholipid antibodies are a heterogeneous group of autoantibodies associated with the hypercoagulable state affecting all vascular districts with thrombosis named antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS is an autoimmune disease with multifactorial etiology that includes cellular, molecular, genetic and pathogenic mechanisms. The APS clinical features are a combination of arterial and/or venous thrombosis, hematological events, recurrent fetal losses, neurological disorders and intra-abdominal manifestations. The renal involvement is associated with both primary and secondary APS. Clinical features include hypertension, renal artery stenosis, thrombotic microangiopathy and other histological manifestations of the nephropathy (APSN), venous renal thrombosis, APSN in the course of systemic lupus erythematosus and renal failure. APSN is an independent risk factor that should be included in the classification criteria for definite APS with characteristic clinical and histological features.
