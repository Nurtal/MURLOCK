Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), also known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), includes the most common chronic autoimmune arthropathies of childhood. These two nomenclatures for classification include components representing the major subclasses of disease. The chromosomal regions and the genes involved in these complex genetic traits are being elucidated, with findings often specific for a particular disease subtype. With the advent of new SNP technologies, progress is being made at an ever-increasing pace. This review discusses the difficulties of deciphering the genetic components in complex disorders, while demonstrating the similarities that JRA shares with other autoimmune disorders. Particular emphasis has been placed on positive findings either for candidate genes that have been replicated independently in JRA/JIA, or findings in JRA for which consistent results have been reported in other forms of autoimmunity.
