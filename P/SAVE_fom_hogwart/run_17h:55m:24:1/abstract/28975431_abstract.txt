Currently published data regarding the potential role of procalcitonin (PCT) for the discrimination between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flare and infection are contradictory. To derive a more precise evaluation, a meta-analysis was performed. Published literatures from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were obtained. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the study quality. Pooled standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by random-effect model analysis. Heterogeneity test was performed by the Q statistic and quantified using I 2. Eight studies including 205 SLE flare patients and 198 SLE patients with infection were finally incorporated in the meta-analysis after examining title, type, abstracts, and full text. No significant differences in plasma/serum PCT levels were found between SLE patients with flare and SLE patients with infection when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis (pooled SMD = - 0.45, 95% CI = - 0.96 to 0.06). However, subgroup analysis showed that Asian SLE patients with infection had higher plasma/serum PCT levels when compared with SLE patients with flare (p < 0.001). Overall, there is no significant difference in plasma/serum PCT levels between SLE patients with flare and SLE patients with infection. However, plasma/serum PCT levels are significantly higher in Asian SLE patients with infection.
