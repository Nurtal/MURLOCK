Many case-control studies have investigated the role of TGF-β1 gene +869C/T promoter polymorphism in autoimmune diseases, but the results are inconsistent. To clarify this point, we performed a meta-analysis based on all available studies in Pubmed, Elsevier Science Direct, Google Searching, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to estimate the strength of the association. A fixed or random effects model was used on the basis of heterogeneity. A total of 21 papers including 2,693 cases and 3,036 controls were considered in the current meta-analysis. These studies encompass two ankylosing spondylitis (AS), eight rheumatoid arthritis (RA), four systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and seven systemic sclerosis (SSc). The results showed that TGF-β1 +869C/T promoter polymorphism were associated with susceptibility to RA (CC vs. TT: OR=0.65, 95% CI=0.48-0.88, P=0.005; CC vs. CT+TT: OR=0.56, 95% CI=0.45-0.69, P=0.000; C vs. T: OR=0.81, 95% CI=0.71-0.93, P=0.003). When stratified by race, significant association was observed only in Asian population. However, we failed to reveal the association between this gene promoter polymorphism and AS, SLE, and SSc. Therefore, this meta-analysis suggests a possible association between TGF-β1 +869C/T promoter polymorphism and RA, especially in Asian population.
