Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a risk factor for hypertension. Previously, we demonstrated that an established mouse model of SLE (female NZBWF1 mice) develops hypertension with renal inflammation and oxidative stress, both characteristics known as contributing mechanisms to the development of salt-sensitive hypertension. On the basis of this model, we hypothesized that blood pressure in SLE mice would be salt-sensitive. Thirty-week-old female SLE and control mice (NZW/LacJ) were fed 8% high-salt (HS) diet or normal diet (0.4% salt) for 4 wk. Plasma levels of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) autoantibodies, a marker of SLE disease activity, were increased in SLE mice compared with controls (472 ± 148 vs. 57 ± 17 U/ml × 1,000, P < 0.001). HS did not alter dsDNA autoantibody levels in SLE or control mice. Mean arterial pressure was increased in SLE mice compared with controls (132 ± 3 vs. 118 ± 2 mmHg, P < 0.001) and was not significantly altered by the HS diet in either group. Similarly, albuminuria was higher in SLE mice compared with controls (10.7 ± 9.0 vs. 0.3 ± 0.1 mg/day) but was not significantly increased in SLE or control mice fed a HS diet. In summary, blood pressure during SLE is not salt-sensitive, and the HS diet did not adversely affect SLE disease activity or significantly augment albuminuria. These data suggest that renal inflammation and oxidative stress, characteristics common to both SLE and models of salt-sensitive hypertension, may have diverging mechanistic roles in the development of hypertension.
