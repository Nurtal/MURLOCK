Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex polygenic inflammatory disease associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, which is the main cause of increased cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in RA patients. CARD8 is a constituent of inflammasome, which regulates interleukin 1-beta production, and has been associated with a worse disease course in early RA. One thousand six hundred twenty-one patients fulfilling the 1987 ACR classification criteria for RA and 1300 matched controls, were genotyped for the CARD8 rs2043211 (30T>A, p.C10X) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) using predesigned TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. The genotyping success rate in our study was greater than 94%. We assessed CARD8 rs2043211 gene polymorphism results in 1530 Spanish RA patients in whom information on CV disease and CV risk factors was available at the time of the study. Also, a subgroup of patients with no history of CV events (n=276) was assessed for the potential influence of the rs2043211 variant in the development of subclinical atherosclerosis, by measurement of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and presence of carotid plaques. No statistically significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies for the rs2043211 CARD8 gene variant between patients with RA and controls were seen. Similarly, CARD8 rs2043211 (30T>A, p.C10X) SNP did not influence the development of CV events or the risk of CV events throughout the time. Likewise, no significant association between this gene variant and carotid IMT or the presence of plaques was found. In summary, our results do not support a role of the CARD8 rs2043211 gene variant in susceptibility to RA or in the development of CV disease in patients with RA.
