The New Zealand Black x New Zealand White F1 [(NZB/NZW) F1] mouse develops an autoimmune condition resembling aspects of human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We investigated the effects of a novel prophylactic thoraco-abdominal gamma irradiation protocol on the onset and evolution of lupus in these animals. Survival of irradiated mice was higher when compared with nonirradiated mice. Kidney lesions were milder and autoantibody levels were lower in irradiated mice. To identify possible mechanisms involved in the radiation-induced improvement of disease, distinct components of humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated. Because B-1 cells are known to be involved in various autoimmune diseases, we investigated the participation of these cells in SLE progression. Unexpectedly, B-1 cells were not depleted in (NZB/NZW) F1, even after several rounds of irradiation. No alterations were found in viability and physiology of B-1 cells in SLE animals with the exception of constitutive overexpression of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2, which may account for the observed radioresistance. Thus, a role for B-1 cells in murine SLE cannot be excluded, since the irradiation protocol did not effectively eliminate these cells. Additionally, we demonstrate a marked delay in the ability of splenocytes to repopulate the spleen after irradiation in (NZB/NZW) F1, in contrast to leucocytes in other cellular compartments. The implications of these findings for the fate of SLE in this model are discussed.
