Glomerular injury can be caused by numerous insults including hemodynamics, infections and immunity, hereditary and metabolic diseases, and toxicity. Basic and translational experimental studies in combination with clinical research in patients with renal disease have advanced our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of many forms of glomerulonephritis. This new knowledge has facilitated classification and treatment and has contributed to a better outcome of patients with renal disease. Since renal disease almost without exception leads to systemic cardiovascular complications, these advances are also of general health interest. Here, we shall briefly review general principles in the pathology of glomerular injury and discuss recent developments in the study of podocytopathies; membranous glomerulopathy; ANCA-associated vasculitis; C3 glomerulopathies and the role of complement in endothelial injury; and the prognostic value of the renal biopsy in predicting long-term outcome in lupus nephritis, vasculitis and IgA nephropathy.
