Ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) is characterized by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in patients lacking typical features of type 1 diabetes. A validated classification scheme for KPD includes two autoantibody-negative ("A-") phenotypic forms: "A-β-" (lean, early onset, lacking β-cell functional reserve) and "A-β+" (obese, late onset, with substantial β-cell functional reserve after the index episode of DKA). Recent longitudinal analysis of a large KPD cohort revealed that the A-β+ phenotype includes two distinct subtypes distinguished by the index DKA episode having a defined precipitant ("provoked," with progressive β-cell function loss over time) or no precipitant ("unprovoked," with sustained β-cell functional reserve). These three A- KPD subtypes are characterized by absence of humoral islet autoimmune markers, but a role for cellular islet autoimmunity is unknown.
