We validated case ascertainment algorithms for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in the provincial health administrative databases of Manitoba, Canada. A population-based pediatric rheumatology clinical database from April 1st 1980 to March 31st 2012 was used to test case definitions in individuals diagnosed at ≤15 years of age. The case definitions varied the number of diagnosis codes (1, 2, or 3), time frame (1, 2 or 3 years), time between diagnoses (ever, >1 day, or ≥8 weeks), and physician specialty. Positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported. A case definition of 1 hospitalization or ≥2 diagnoses in 2 years by any provider ≥8 weeks apart using diagnosis codes for rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis produced a sensitivity of 89.2% (95% CI 86.8, 91.6), specificity of 86.3% (95% CI 83.0, 89.6), and PPV of 90.6% (95% CI 88.3, 92.9) when seronegative enthesopathy and arthropathy (SEA) was excluded as JIA; and sensitivity of 88.2% (95% CI 85.7, 90.7), specificity of 90.4% (95% CI 87.5, 93.3), and PPV of 93.9% (95% CI 92.0, 95.8) when SEA was included as JIA. This study validates case ascertainment algorithms for JIA in Canadian administrative health data using diagnosis codes for both rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis, to better reflect current JIA classification than codes for RA alone. Researchers will be able to use these results to define cohorts for population-based studies.
