To compare Doppler ultrasound (US) and 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (3.0-T MRI) findings of synovial inflammation in the tendons and joints in an early polyarthritis cohort (patients who presented < 1 year after arthritis onset) using a bilateral hand and wrist evaluation. Also, to evaluate the diagnostic performance of US and MRI findings for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), their ability to predict RA as a diagnostic outcome, and their capacity to improve the accuracy of the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) RA classification criteria in early arthritis.
