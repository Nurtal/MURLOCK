A urine metabolomics method based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was developed in order to investigate the metabolite characteristics of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the therapeutic effects of Jieduquyuziyin prescription. The urinary metabolic profiles in urine specimens of the SLE model mice (MRL/lpr) group, prednisone acetate-treated SLE mouse group, Jieduquyuziyin prescription-treated SLE mouse group, and control group (C57BL/6â€‰J) after the administration were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These metabolic profiles were then processed by multivariate analysis, in particular Mass Profiler Professional, SIMCA-P and partial least-squares discriminant analysis. According to the partial least-squares discriminant analysis results, the SLE model group and the control group were obviously separated, indicating that the incidence of SLE had a greater impact on the metabolic network, and the SLE model group had significant difference compared with the control group in urine metabolites. Eleven differential metabolites were identified to be related to SLE, and the results of differential metabolite identification showed that the metabolites were mainly related to energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism pathway. These results can provide an experimental basis for further exploring the mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of SLE.
