Currently few studies have been reported to utilize matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) in rheumatic disease, especially in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Our aim was to find differentially expressed disease-related and condition-specific peptides in sera from patients with SLE, as well as to develop and validate the peptide classification model for the diagnosis of SLE.
