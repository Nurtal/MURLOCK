The identification of functional gene modules that are derived from integration of information from different types of networks is a powerful strategy for interpreting the etiology of complex diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Genetic variants are known to increase the risk of developing RA. Here, a novel method, the construction of a genetic network, was used to mine functional gene modules linked with RA. A polymorphism interaction analysis (PIA) algorithm was used to obtain cooperating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that contribute to RA disease. The acquired SNP pairs were used to construct a SNP-SNP network. Sub-networks defined by hub SNPs were then extracted and turned into gene modules by mapping SNPs to genes using dbSNP database. We performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis on each gene module, and some GO terms enriched in the gene modules can be used to investigate clustered gene function for better understanding RA pathogenesis. This method was applied to the Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 (GAW 15) RA dataset. The results show that genes involved in functional gene modules, such as CD160 (rs744877) and RUNX1 (rs2051179), are especially relevant to RA, which is supported by previous reports. Furthermore, the 43 SNPs involved in the identified gene modules were found to be the best classifiers when used as variables for sample classification.
