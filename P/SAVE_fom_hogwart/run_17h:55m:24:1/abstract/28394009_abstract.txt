The testicular arteries (TAs) also known as Internal spermatic arteries are long and slender arteries usually arising from the anterolateral aspect of the abdominal aorta (AA), 2.5 cm to 5 cm caudal to the renal arteries (RA). The variation in testicular arteries may be found with respect to their origin, number or course. They can originate from the abdominal aorta itself at an abnormal level. If not arising from abdominal aorta the TA variants may arise from renal artery, supra renal artery or any one of the lumbar arteries. Rarely it can arise from common or internal iliac artery, or from the superior epigastric artery. The most common variation with respect to origin of TA was found in association with renal vessels. In regard to their number, double TA was found to be most common and with respect to course most common variation was arched TA over ipsilateral renal vein. The arched TA at times on right side had a retrocaval course. Occurrence of TA variants are explained with embryology and the knowledge of its clinical significance is essential for future surgeons for designing vascular surgeries. Four studies had attempted to classify TA variants regarding their origin, number and course but they could not accommodate recently found TA variants. This led to our new proposed classification.
