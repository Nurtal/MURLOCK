In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), symptoms of joint stiffness and pain may be most severe in the morning, resulting in impaired ability to carry out normal morning functions. Although morning stiffness was included in the criteria for classification and remission of RA, defined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 1987, the approach to assessment of this circadian symptom has not been standardized, and other circadian aspects of the disease (i.e. pain, functional ability) were not included. A bibliographic study of papers published in English in the period January 2007 to January 2010 and reporting morning stiffness, pain or function was undertaken to investigate methods of assessing circadian aspects of RA. A total of 73 studies were identified using Medline, including 62 clinical trials. Full papers were obtained for 52 reports of clinical studies (84%), most of which (44/52, 85%) assessed duration of morning stiffness. Only two studies (4%) specified that severity of morning stiffness was assessed, only three (6%) assessed pain in the morning, and none assessed morning functional ability. These findings suggest the need for consistent reporting of a measure to reflect the impaired morning function, arising from joint stiffness and pain that is commonly experienced by patients.
