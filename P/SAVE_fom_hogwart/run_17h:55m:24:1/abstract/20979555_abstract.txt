Renal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus patients is a severe disease manifestation characterized by various clinical and histopathological alterations. The revised International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society 2003 classification defines the subclasses of lupus nephritis (LN) according to their pathological glomerular patterns, which has a crucial impact on the prognosis and treatment options for LN patients. There are widely accepted therapeutic agents available, such as cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine and corticosteroids. Several trials have tried to determine a gold standard for induction and maintenance therapy in LN, and the place of newer drugs, biologicals, has been investigated. We review recently reported data on current treatment regimens in LN, in particular in the context of the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society 2003 classification.
