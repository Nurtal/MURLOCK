CD95 (Fas-ligand) is a key mediator of cell death in multiple setting, thus its loss within the MRL-lpr (Faslpr) homozygote mice results in spontaneous autoimmunity. This is characterized by the development of arthritis and immune complex glomerulonephrosis making this strain a useful model for studying systemic lupus erythematosus. Herein we describe a method to exploit the heterozygote offspring of this strain in a model to study the effects of a CD95L blocking peptide on lupus-like disease in vivo.
