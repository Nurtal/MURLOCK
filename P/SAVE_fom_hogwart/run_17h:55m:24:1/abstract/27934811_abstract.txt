The 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria were criticised for classifying patients only in the late stage. The 2010 ACR/European League against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were thus formulated to recognize the early stage of disease with high sensitivity. This pilot study was designed to estimate and compare the sensitivities of the 1987 ACR and 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA.
