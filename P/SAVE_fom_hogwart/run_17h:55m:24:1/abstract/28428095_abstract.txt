Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is the 2nd most common chronic autoimmune rheumatic disease and associated with a high burden of illness. Morbidity arises not only from untreated xerostomia and keratoconjunctivitis sicca but also from extra-glandular manifestations including the development of non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphomas. Proper diagnosis of SS requires objective evidence of dry eyes and/or objective evidence of dry mouth as well as proof of autoimmunity. The recent development of new international classification criteria and clinical practice guidelines for SS should not only enhance the existing standards of care but also facilitate further studies to improve future diagnosis and outcomes.
