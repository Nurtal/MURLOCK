Celastrol is a bioactive compound derived from traditional Chinese medicinal herbs of the Celastraceae family. Celastrol is known to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Our studies have highlighted the immunomodulatory attributes of celastrol in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA), an experimental model of human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the synovial lining of the joints, leading eventually to tissue damage and deformities. Identification of the molecular targets of celastrol such as the NF-ÎºB pathway, MAPK pathway, JAK/STAT pathway and RANKL/OPG pathway has unraveled its strategic checkpoints in controlling arthritic inflammation and tissue damage in AA. The pathological events that are targeted and rectified by celastrol include increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines; an imbalance between pathogenic T helper 17 and regulatory T cells; enhanced production of chemokines coupled with increased migration of immune cells into the joints; and increased release of mediators of osteoclastic bone damage. Accordingly, celastrol is a promising candidate for further testing in the clinic for RA therapy. Furthermore, the results of other preclinical studies suggest that celastrol might also be beneficial for the treatment of a few other autoimmune diseases besides arthritis.
