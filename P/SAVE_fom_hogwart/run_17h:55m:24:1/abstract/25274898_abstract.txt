Anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) are considered specific markers of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and have been included in the revised classification criteria for RA diagnosis. However, these antibodies have also been detected in patients with other types of chronic inflammatory rheumatism. Our objectives were to identify the prevalence of positive anti-CCP patients in non-RA diseases, to determine the diagnostic value of anti-CCP for the diagnosis of RA, to specify the clinical characteristics of non-RA patients positive for anti-CCP, and to determine the discriminatory value of the levels of anti-CCP in patients among the various diseases.
