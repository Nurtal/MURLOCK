Lupus mesenteric vasculitis (LMV) is a rare cause of acute abdominal pain. Few cases of LMV have been reported in adults, children and adolescents. However, to our knowledge, the prevalence of that severe vasculitis in a pediatric population with lupus is yet to be studied. This study reviewed data from 28 consecutive years and included 5,508 patients being followed up at the hospital of the Faculdade de Medicina of the Univesidade de SÃ£o Paulo (FMUSP). We identified 279 (5.1%) patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), one of whom (0.4%) had LMV. That male patient was diagnosed with SLE at the age of 11 years. At the age of 13 years, he was hospitalized with diffuse and acute abdominal pain, nausea, bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, rebound tenderness, and abdominal muscle guarding. The patient underwent laparotomy immediately, and segmentary intestinal ischemia with intestinal wall edema and adhesions were identified. Partial small bowel resection with lysis of the adhesions was performed, as were pulses of intravenous methylprednisolone. The histopathologic analysis evidenced mesenteric arteritis. After 13 days, the diffuse and intense abdominal pain recurred, and the patient underwent a new laparotomy, during which adhesive small bowel obstruction with intestinal gangrene was identified. New intestinal resection was performed, and the patient received pulses of intravenous methylprednisolone and infusion of immunoglobulin. Thus, LMV is a rare and severe abdominal manifestation of the pediatric population with lupus, and can be the only manifestation of disease activity. In addition, this study stresses the importance of the early diagnosis and immediate treatment.
