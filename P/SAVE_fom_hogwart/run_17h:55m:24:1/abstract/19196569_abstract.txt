Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients have increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) that cannot be fully explained by the traditional risk factors. Metabolic alterations like oxidative stress and insulin resistance may be additional risk factors to contribute early and accelerated atherosclerosis in SLE. Our aim was to evaluate malondialdehyde (MDA) level, oxidative stress indicator, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and possible relationship between oxidative stress and insulin resistance, in SLE.
