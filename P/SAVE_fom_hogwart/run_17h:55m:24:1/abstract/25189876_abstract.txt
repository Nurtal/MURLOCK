Antibodies against citrullinated antigens (ACPA) represent one rheumatoid arthritis (RA) classification criteria. Recently, mutated and citrullinated vimentin (MCV), containing approx. 45 potentially citrullinated sites, was characterised as another modified autoantigenic RA target. Therefore, we wanted to screen, select and validate predominant MCV autoantigenic epitopes (called here MCE) as possible new diagnostic targets.
