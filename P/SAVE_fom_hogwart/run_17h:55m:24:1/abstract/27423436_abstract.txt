The association between hepatitis B and autoimmune disorders has been intriguing for decades. Many reports have speculated on the possible linkage between these two conditions, yet never before data driven from a large national database was utilized in order to investigate this issue. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between SLE and hepatitis B carrier state. Patients with SLE were compared with age- and sex-matched controls regarding the proportion of hepatitis B carrier state in a case-control study. Chi-square and t tests were used for univariate analysis, and a logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. The study was performed utilizing the medical database of Clalit Health Services. The study included 5018 lupus patients over the age of 20 years and 25,090 age- and sex-frequency-matched controls without SLE. The proportion of hepatitis B carriers was higher in SLE patients as compared to controls (0.9 and 0.56 %, respectively; p < 0.001). A significant association was also observed among patients in lower socioeconomic status. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, SLE was significantly associated with hepatitis B (OR = 1.828, 95 % CI = 1.291-2.590). Patients with SLE have a greater proportion of hepatitis B carrier state than matched controls.
