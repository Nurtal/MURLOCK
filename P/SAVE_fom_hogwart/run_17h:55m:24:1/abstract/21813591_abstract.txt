The pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been attributed to complex interactions between genetic, hormonal and environmental factors. The influence of a genetic predisposition to SLE is supported by family aggregation and a high concordance rate in monozygotic twins. Here we present a rare case of simultaneous presentation of SLE and lupus nephritis in a mother and son. Both patients had nephrotic-range proteinuria, and the renal pathological classifications of the son and his mother were Class IV-G (A) and Class III (A/C), respectively, according to the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) 2003 classification of lupus nephritis. Apart from the renal involvement, both patients had leucopenia and anemia, and the mother also had typical cutaneous lesions and secondary Sj√∂gren's syndrome. This case supports the genetic role in the etiology of SLE, and displayed different clinical presentations and disease severity in familial SLE patients of different gender and age.
