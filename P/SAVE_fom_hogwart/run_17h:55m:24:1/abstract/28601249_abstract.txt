The 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria were derived to classify rheumatoid arthritis (RA) earlier in time. Previous studies indeed observed that the 2010 criteria were fulfilled earlier than the 1987 criteria. This study determined whether the 2010 criteria perform equally in early classification of autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-negative RA.
