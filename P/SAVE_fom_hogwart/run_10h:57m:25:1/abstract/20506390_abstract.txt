Skin disease is the second most common manifestation in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) preligand assembly domain (PLAD) has been found to block the effect of TNFalpha, and TNFRI PLAD (p60 PLAD) inhibits inflammatory arthritis. This study was undertaken to investigate whether TNFR PLAD limits inflammatory skin injury in a mouse model of SLE.
