Our understanding of the mechanisms leading to rheumatic diseases is growing at unprecedented pace thanks to the worldwide network of clinical and translational researchers who gather at major scientific meetings to share their progresses. Further, these meetings allow the contamination of unrelated research areas and thus the spreading of ideas, hypotheses, and research tools. The annual meeting of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) serves this purpose by allowing thousands of rheumatologists, immunologists, health care professionals, and basic scientists to attend the same sessions and present their work. The 2014 ACR meeting was held in Boston, MA, and was attended by over 16,000 participants who had the opportunity to directly witness the presentation of over 3000 abstracts. As such is the case, a full attendance of all update opportunities was not feasible. To fill this gap we arbitrarily selected the abstracts the appeared most interesting in a few fields of interest and we herein discuss the presented data and their further implications. In particular, we were intrigued by research advances in biomarkers for rheumatic diseases, and by advances on Sj√∂gren syndrome, neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus, fibromyalgia, and B cell mechanisms. While we are well aware of the numerous blind spots that are expected in this type of article, we submit that this is far from a comprehensive overview and refer to the abstract book for a more complete analysis of the presented abstracts.
