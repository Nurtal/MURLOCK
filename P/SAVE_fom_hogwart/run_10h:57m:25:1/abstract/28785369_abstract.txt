Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic relapsing-remitting autoimmune disease with highly heterogeneous phenotypes. Biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity are useful for early diagnosis as well as monitoring disease activity and long-term complications. Epigenetics potentially provide novel biomarkers in autoimmune diseases. These may include DNA methylation changes in relevant lupus-prone genes or histone modifications and microRNAs to upregulate and downregulate relevant gene expression. The timing and nature of epigenetic modification provide such changes. In lupus, DNA methylation alterations in cytokine genes, such as IFN-related gene and retrovirus gene, have been found to offer biomarkers for lupus diagnosis. Histone modifications such as histone methylation and acetylation lead to transcriptional alterations of several genes such as PTPN22, LRP1B, and TNFSF70. There are varieties of microRNAs applied as lupus biomarkers, including DNMT1-related microRNAs, renal function-associated microRNAs, microRNAs involved in the immune system, and microRNAs for phenotype classification. Thus, we conclude a wide range of promising roles of epigenetic biomarkers aiding in the diagnosing and monitoring of lupus diseases and the risk of organ damage.
