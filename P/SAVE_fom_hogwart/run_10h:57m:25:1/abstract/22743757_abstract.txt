The association of allergic diseases and disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, lupus) is controversial. The study investigates lupus activity-related differences in the induction of late allergic rhinitis (LAR) in the female NZB×NZW(B/W)F(1) mouse model for lupus. The LAR, which is induced by ovalbumin, was examined during the preactive (before clinical onset) and active (after clinical onset) phases in mice. Induction of LAR was less severe in mice with active lupus in contrast to clinically healthy lupus mice that developed a more severe allergic rhinitis. Inhibition of the development of LAR may be due to reduced eosinophilia and local interleukin-4 secretion during active autoimmune disease. In addition, systemic interferon-γ, but not IL-4, production increased during the active phase, but not the preactive phase. This suggests that the predominating Th1 lineage commitment in mice with active lupus may be responsible for the inhibition of the allergic Th2 response. The present study may shed some light on the controversy of the prevalence of allergic diseases in SLE patients.
