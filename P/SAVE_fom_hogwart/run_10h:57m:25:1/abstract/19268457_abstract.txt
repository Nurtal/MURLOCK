Evidence have indicated the impairment of central nervous system (CNS) and neuropsychiatric disorder in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, little is known to improve the brain abnormality in SLE. To investigate the effect of cystamine on brain abnormality in SLE, NZB/W F1 mice were used as the animal model. Notably, significantly reduced neural Nitric Oxide Synthase (nNOS), inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS), p53, p21(WAF1/CIP1), and heat shock protein (HSP)-90 proteins were detected in the brain of NZB/W F1 mice that were treated with cystamine. In contrast, no variation was observed between the brain samples of BALB/c mice that were treated with PBS or cystamine. Moreover, significantly reduced Toll-like receptors- (TLR-) 4, 5 and 7 were detected in the brain samples of NZB/W F1 mice that were treated with cystamine whereas no variation of TLR-4, TLR-5, TLR-7, and TLR-9 was observed in BALB/c mice that were treated with PBS or cystamine. These findings demonstrated the beneficial effects of cystamine on brain abnormality in NZB/W F1 mice and probably suggested the potential of cystamine on treating patients with neuropsychiatric SLE.
