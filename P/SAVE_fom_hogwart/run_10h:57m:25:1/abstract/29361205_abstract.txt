Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has limited monozygotic (MZ) twin concordance, implying a role for other pathogenic factors than genetic variation, such as epigenetic changes. Using the disease discordant twin model, we investigated genome-wide DNA methylation changes in sorted CD4+ T-cells, monocytes, granulocytes and B-cells in twin pairs with at least one SLE-affected twin.
