Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease that is characterized by the production of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and leads to immune complex deposition in the kidneys and nephritis. Lyn tyrosine kinase is a regulator of antibody-mediated autoimmune disease, as evidenced by studies in gene-targeted mice and as suggested in genome-wide association studies in SLE. Like SLE patients, Lyn-deficient mice have increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Deletion of IL-6 from Lyn-deficient mice abrogates levels of inflammation, pathogenic autoantibodies, and nephritis. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of IL-6 trans-signaling in autoimmune disease by overexpressing soluble gp130Fc (sgp130Fc) in a mouse model.
