Mice with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) induced by transferring parental BALB/C lymphocytes into (C57BL/6 Ã— BALB/C) F1 (CBF1) hybrids, develop a syndrome characterized by B-cell hyperactivity, autoantibody production, and immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis. In this model, we evaluated the role of leflunomide on the development of lupus nephritis in system autoimmunity. Daily administration of leflunomide (15 mg/kg/d) from 2 weeks after cGVHD induction can dramatically reduce the production of autoantibodies and immune complex deposition in the kidney, leading to relieved kidney damage and reduced mortality. The therapeutic effect of leflunomide on the lupus-prone mice was partially due to the inhibition of TLR9 signaling pathway, which was an important component of innate immune system.
