The aim of this meta-analysis was to summarize results on the association of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1(MCP-1) promoter -2518 A/G polymorphism with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) susceptibility. We searches all the publications about the association between MCP-1 promoter -2518 A/G polymorphism and SLE from Pubmed, Elsevier Science Direct, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure. The meta-analysis was performed for genotypes AA verse GG, AA+AG verse GG, AA verse AG+GG, and A allele verse G allele in a fixed/random effect model. A total of 14 studies (2,333 cases and 2,391 controls) were included in the meta-analysis. When all groups were pooled, we had not observed significant association between A allele and G allele (OR = 0.94, 95 %CI = 0.79-1.12, P = 0.50). When analysis were restricted to more ethnically homogeneous populations, the similar results were found in European population and Asian population (OR = 1.05, 95 %CI = 0.75-1.46, P = 0.80; OR = 1.00, 95 %CI = 0.86-1.17, P = 0.99). However, we had not detected a significant association between MCP-1 promoter -2518 A/G polymorphism and SLE when examining the genotypes AA verse GG, AA+AG verse GG, AA verse AG+GG. The meta-analysis did not demonstrate the association between MCP-1 promoter -2518 A/G polymorphism and SLE.
