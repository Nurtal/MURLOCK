Transgenic mice expressing a rearranged T cell receptor (TCR)-αβ prematurely at the double-negative stage develop an abnormal population of peripheral T cells that lack CD4 and CD8 expression and are hyper-reactive to anti-TCR antibody stimulation. One such example is the HY-TCR transgenic mice. These mice express a TCR transgenic specific for the HY antigen that is expressed in male but not in female mice. As a result, male mice have an abnormal population of HY(+)/CD4(-)8(-) or HY(+)/CD4(-)CD8(low) T cells that are much lower in female mice. In this study, we investigated the potential patho/physiological function of these cells in vivo using a model of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction: the λ-carrageenan-induced paw edema. Interestingly, while both male and female HY-TCR mice develop a classical biphasic inflammatory response to λ-carrageenan, the degree of inflammation in the former was much higher than that in the latter. This was accompanied by a selective expansion of HY(+)/CD4(-)8(-) and HY(+)/CD4(-)CD8(low) T cells in male mice and by a markedly increased production of typical DTH cytokines compared with cells from female mice. These results were specific since analysis of the inflammatory response of HY-TCR transgenic mice subjected to zymosan-induced peritonitis showed no differences between male and female mice. Together, these findings provide novel evidence for the pathological role of self-reactive CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells, previously described in several autoimmune strains and recently identified in patients suffering from autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus.
