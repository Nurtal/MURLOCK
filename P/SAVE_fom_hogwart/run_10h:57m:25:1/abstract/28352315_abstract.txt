Daphnetin is a compound extracted from Chinese medicinal herbs, which exerts analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. The present study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of daphnetin on inflammation in the NZB/W F1 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) murine model. Female NZB/WF1 mice (age, 16-18 weeks) were intraperitoneally injected with daphnetin once a day for 12 weeks. It was revealed that daphnetin treatment significantly increased animal survival rates, reduced renal damage and blood urea nitrogen levels, and suppressed serum autoantibody production in the SLE-prone NZB/W F1 mice. In addition, daphnetin treatment significantly decreased the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6, inhibited nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity, suppressed the protein expression of nuclear factor of activated T-cells and promoted A20 protein expression in SLE-prone NZB/W F1 mice. In conclusion, daphnetin inhibited inflammation in the NZB/W F1 murine SLE model via inhibition of NF-κB mediated by upregulation of A20.
