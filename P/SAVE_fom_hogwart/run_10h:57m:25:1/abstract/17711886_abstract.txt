Approximately 15% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) will have the onset of their disease in childhood or adolescence. Due to the broad range of possible clinical features of SLE, the diagnosis may be difficult to make in a general pediatric or community setting. The common symptoms of SLE in children and adolescents include fever, fatigue, weight loss, arthritis, rash and renal disease. SLE is more common in non-Caucasian ethnic groups and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a multisystem disease in these patients. In this article, the classification criteria for SLE are discussed, and an approach to making an accurate and timely diagnosis of this disease is considered.
