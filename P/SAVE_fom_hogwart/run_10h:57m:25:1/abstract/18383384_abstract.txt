The detection of high titers of antibodies against small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) is a diagnostic finding in patients in whom systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is suspected. Endogenous RNA molecules within snRNP trigger Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7) activation in B cells and dendritic cells, leading to anti-snRNP antibody production, which is associated with the development of immune complex nephritis in SLE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of TLR-7 in anti-snRNP antibody production and renal disease in SLE induced by an exogenous factor in the absence of genetic predisposition, using the pristane-induced murine lupus model.
