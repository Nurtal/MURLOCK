Family aggregation was observed among systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cases, suggesting the genetic factor may contribute to the susceptibility. Toll-like receptors (TLR) play key role in human immune system; in order to gain better insight on the association between TLR4 polymorphisms and SLE risk, a meta-analysis was conducted. In total 4 case-control studies have been included, involving 503 SLE cases and 636 healthy controls. The association between TLR4 polymorphisms and SLE risk was evaluated by calculating pooled odd ratio (OR) and its 95% confidential interval (CI). The Q-test and I (2) statistic were used to estimate the degree of heterogeneity. Publication bias among enrolled studies was examined by using Egger's test and Begg's test. Overall, there was no evidence of positive association between SLE risk and D299G and T399I polymorphisms in TLR4. The meta-analysis reported a null association between TLR4 polymorphisms and SLE risk in included study populations, but the role of TLR4 polymorphisms in developing SLE among other populations remains undetermined. Moreover, some laboratory studies still discovered the involvement of TLR4 in SLE process. Therefore, the association between TLR4 polymorphisms and SLE risk requires further investigation both in laboratory and in epidemiological efforts.
