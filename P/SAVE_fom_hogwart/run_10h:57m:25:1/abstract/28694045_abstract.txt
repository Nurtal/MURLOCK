SLE-associated acute transverse myelitis (ATM) is a rare, but potentially severe complication of Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and may lead to significant motor, sensory and autonomic dysfunctions in the central nervous system resulting in marked neurological deficits. It is important to recognize its clinical feature to allow timely diagnosis and management of this condition. In this review, we aimed to provide the reader with the understanding of its clinical presentation and classification, the underlying pathological, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) appearance, and current status of management, with an emphasis on recent discoveries and advancements.
