Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that predominantly affects women and is associated with prevalent hypertension, renal injury, and cardiovascular disease. Immune system dysfunction is recognized as an important factor in the pathogenesis of hypertension. We recently showed that preventing autoimmunity prevents the development of hypertension in an experimental model of SLE (female NZBWF1 mice). The present study tests the hypothesis that mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an immunosuppressive therapy used clinically to treat SLE by depleting proliferating B and T lymphocytes, can improve blood pressure control.
