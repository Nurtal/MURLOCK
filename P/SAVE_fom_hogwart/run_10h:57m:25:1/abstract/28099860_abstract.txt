A hallmark of autoimmunity in murine models of lupus is the formation of germinal centers (GCs) in lymphoid tissues where self-reactive B cells expand and differentiate. In the host response to foreign antigens, follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) maintain GCs through the uptake and cycling of complement-opsonized immune complexes. Here, we examined whether FDCs retain self-antigens and the impact of this process in autoantibody secretion in lupus. We found that FDCs took up and retained self-immune complexes composed of ribonucleotide proteins, autoantibody, and complement. This uptake, mediated through CD21, triggered endosomal TLR7 and led to the secretion of interferon (IFN) α via an IRF5-dependent pathway. Blocking of FDC secretion of IFN-α restored B cell tolerance and reduced the amount of GCs and pathogenic autoantibody. Thus, FDCs are a critical source of the IFN-α driving autoimmunity in this lupus model. This pathway is conserved in humans, suggesting that it may be a viable therapeutic target in systemic lupus erythematosus.
