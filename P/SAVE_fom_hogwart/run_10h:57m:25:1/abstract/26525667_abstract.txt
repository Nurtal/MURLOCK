Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a widespread organ involvement. Recent studies have suggested that extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) might possess preventive effects on this immunoinflammation-related disease. However, its role in SLE remained unknown. In this work, we evaluated the effects of EVOO diet in a pristane-induced SLE model in mice. Three-month-old mice received an injection of pristane or saline solution and were fed with different experimental diets: sunflower oil diet or EVOO diet. After 24weeks, mice were sacrificed, spleens were collected and kidneys were removed for immunoinflammatory detections. The kidney expression of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) and nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways were studied by western blotting. In addition to macroscopic and histological analyses, serum matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3) levels and proinflammatory cytokines production in splenocytes were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunoassay. We have demonstrated that EVOO diet significantly reduced renal damage and decreased MMP-3 serum and PGE2 kidney levels as well as the proinflammatory cytokines production in splenocytes. Our data indicate that Nrf-2 and HO-1 protein expressions were up-regulated in those mice fed with EVOO and the activation of JAK/STAT, MAPK and NF-κB pathways were drastically ameliorated. These results support the interest of EVOO as a beneficial functional food exerting a preventive/palliative role in the management of SLE.
