Sjögren syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by hyposecretion of the lacrimal and salivary glands, resulting in dryness of the eyes and mouth. Individuals may experience primary Sjögren syndrome or a secondary form accompanying another rheumatic autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. The pathogenic mechanisms of Sjögren syndrome remain largely unknown, in part a consequence of the heterogeneity of the disease. Animal models have shed light on the connections between specific pathways and symptoms, but an ideal system is wanting. Improved disease models will enable a better understanding of Sjögren syndrome, including how immune tolerance is lost and potential therapeutic interventions. Most importantly, an optimal model will enable detection of disease biomarkers, since injury to the salivary glands may precede lymphocytic infiltration. This review aims to characterize available mice models of Sjögren syndrome, including advantages and disadvantages, from the researcher's perspective.
