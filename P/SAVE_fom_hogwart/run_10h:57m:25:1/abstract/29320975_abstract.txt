A 30-year-old female presented to the rheumatology outpatient clinic of the Internal Medicine Department, Ain Shams University Hospital, Cairo, Egypt, complaining of a large right leg ulcer consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum. There was history of recurrent attacks of bleeding per rectum of one-year duration. During hospitalization she noticed blurring of vision in the left eye with diffuse blackish discoloration of the feet and toes, consistent with small-vessel vasculitis. Colonoscopy with biopsy and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease-ulcerative colitis (IBD-UC). Meanwhile, the patient fulfilled the SLICC classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): recurrent oral ulcers, positive antinuclear antibody testing, proteinuria >0.5â€‰gm/24-hour urine, positive test for lupus anticoagulant and consumed C3 complement component. Herein we report a rare case of coexistence of SLE and IBD-UC.
