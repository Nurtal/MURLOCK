Our previous work showed that immunization of rabbits with 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-modified Ro60 (HNE-Ro60) accelerates autoimmunity. We extended this model into mice, hypothesizing that the severity of autoimmunity would be dependent on the degree of HNE modification of Ro60. Five groups of BALB/c mice (10/group) were used. Group I was immunized with Ro60. Groups II to IV were immunized with Ro60 modified with 0.4 mM (low), 2 mM (medium), and 10 mM (high) HNE, respectively. Group V controls received Freund's adjuvant. A rapid abrogation of tolerance to Ro60/La antigens occurred in mice immunized with HNE-modified Ro60, especially in the low and medium HNE-Ro60 groups. Lymphocytic infiltration and significantly high decrement in salivary flow (37%) compared to controls was observed only in the high HNE-Ro60 group, suggesting induction of a Sj√∂gren syndrome-like condition in this group. Anti-dsDNA occurred only in mice immunized with medium HNE-Ro60. This group did not have a significant decrement in salivary flow, suggesting induction of a systemic lupus erythematosus-like manifestation in this group. Significantly high antibodies to Ro60 were found in saliva of mice in the low and medium HNE-Ro60 and the Ro60 groups, as well as anti-HNE Ro60 in the low and medium HNE-Ro60 groups. Understanding the mechanism of this differential induction may help discriminate between these two autoimmune diseases.
