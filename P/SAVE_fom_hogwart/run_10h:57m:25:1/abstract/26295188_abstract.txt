Patients with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) may exhibit corpus callosal atrophy and tissue alterations. Measuring the callosal volume and tissue integrity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) could help to differentiate patients with NPSLE from patients without NPSLE. Hence, this study aimed to use an automatic cell-competition algorithm to segment the corpus callosum and to investigate the effects of central nervous system (CNS) involvement on the callosal volume and tissue integrity in patients with SLE.
