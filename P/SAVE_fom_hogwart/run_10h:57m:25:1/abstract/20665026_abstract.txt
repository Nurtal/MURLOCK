Several studies have investigated the roles of genetic polymorphisms in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Some of these studies reported that polymorphisms of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 gene (PARP-1) are linked to rheumatoid arthritis. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase is an enzyme involved in DNA repair, genomic stability, apoptosis, gene transcription, proliferation, and autoimmunity. To determine whether genetic polymorphisms of PARP-1 are related to rheumatoid arthritis in a Korean population, six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which were selected based on LDs and minor allele frequency (MAF > 0.05) in our previous study, were genotyped in 1,202 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 979 unrelated healthy controls. As a result, no significant association between the susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis and PAPR-1 polymorphisms was found. However, in further analysis depending on the radiological severity of rheumatoid arthritis, one PARP-1 polymorphism, rs1805413 (OR = 0.11; 95% CI = 0.02-0.55; P = 0.007; P (corr) = 0.04), and one haplotype (ht6, OR = 0.11; 95% CI = 0.02-0.55; P = 0.007; P (corr) = 0.04) were significantly associated with the radiological severity risk of RA in a recessive model. In addition, a recessive model revealed a correlation between one RA haplotype (ht4) and anti-CCP antibody negativity (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10-0.63, P = 0.003; P (corr) = 0.02). Despite a possible association between PARP-1 and the radiological severity of RA, this study found no statistical association between PARP-1 polymorphisms and the susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis in a Korean population.
