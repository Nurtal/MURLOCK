Toll like receptors (TLRs) are essential molecules implicated in both innate and adaptive immune response. Polymorphisms in TLR gene have been associated with various infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. Role of TLR9 has been elegantly demonstrated in both human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and mice model of lupus. In the present study we investigated association of TLR-9 promoter polymorphisms (T-1237C and T-1486C) with susceptibility/resistance to SLE in an Eastern Indian state which is endemic to parasitic diseases. 210 Female SLE patients who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria were enrolled along with matched healthy controls from Odisha, India. TLR-9 polymorphisms (T-1237C and T-1486C) were typed by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. For meta-analysis, relevant literatures were searched from PubMed database and comprehensive meta-analysis V2 software was employed for analysis. Allele and genotype frequency of TLR-9 promoter polymorphisms (T-1237C and T-1486C) were comparable among SLE patients and controls. Further, meta-analysis of earlier reports and present study did not reveal a significant association of TLR-9 (T-1237C and T-1486C) polymorphisms with SLE. Data from the present study suggest that TLR-9 promoter polymorphisms are not associated with susceptibility to SLE in an area endemic to parasitic diseases.
