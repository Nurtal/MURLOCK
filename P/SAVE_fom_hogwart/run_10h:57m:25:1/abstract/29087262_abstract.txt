Objective The objective of this paper is to investigate the association of clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters between familial systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and sporadic SLE. Methods All relevant literature was retrieved from the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. The qualities of these studies were evaluated using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The characteristics and clinical manifestations of involved individuals were extracted from each study. Pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated using the random effects-method, and the heterogeneity between studies was quantified using the I2 statistic. Results Of 330 studies identified by the search strategy, six were included in this review. In total, 733 cases were familial SLE and 1405 were sporadic SLE. Analysis revealed that photosensitivity, nephritis and thrombocytopenia were negatively associated with familial SLE, with OR (95% CI) values of 0.73 (0.60-0.89), 0.72 (0.59-0.88) and 0.75 (0.57-0.98), respectively. Conclusions Photosensitivity, thrombocytopenia and renal involvement could be more common in non-familial SLE, which should be further confirmed by well-designed studies with large populations.
