The aim of this study is to investigate the association of estrogen receptor alpha gene (ESR1) polymorphisms, additional gene-gene, and gene-environment interaction with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) risk. SNPStats (available online at http://bioinfo.iconcologia.net/SNPstats ) was used to investigate the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in controls and association between SNP and SLE risk. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to screen the interactions among SNPs and environmental risk factors; SLE risk was significantly higher in carriers of rs2234693 C allele than those with TT (TC + CC versus TT), adjusted OR (95%CI) = 1.57 (1.21-2.06), and was also higher in carriers of rs9340799 G allele than those with AA (AG + GG versus AA), adjusted OR (95%CI) = 1.68 (1.24-2.13). However, we also find no association between rs2228480 and SLE risk after covariates adjustment. We found a significant two-locus model (p = 0.0010) involving rs2234693 and smoking; the cross-validation consistency of this model was 10/10, and the testing accuracy was 62.70%. Smokers with TC or CC of rs2234693 genotype have the highest SLE risk, compared to never-smokers with TT of rs2234693 genotype, OR (95%CI) was 2.50 (1.65-3.42), after covariates adjustment for gender, age, alcohol drinking, and BMI. We found that C allele of rs2234693 and G allele of rs9340799 within ESR1 gene, their interaction between rs2234693 and current smoking were all associated with increased SLE risk.
