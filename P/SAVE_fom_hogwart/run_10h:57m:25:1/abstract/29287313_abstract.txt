The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) embarked on a project to re-evaluate classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The first phase of the classification project involved generation of a broad set of items potentially useful for classification of SLE and their selection for use in a subsequent forced-choice decision analysis.
