Memory impairment is prevalent in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); however, its pathogenesis is unknown. In a previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we demonstrated altered brain activity dynamics and less brain deactivation in patients with SLE as compared with healthy controls, when performing a learning and memory task. Our findings localized this impairment to the default mode network (DMN), and particularly to its anterior medial prefrontal cortex node. In addition, altered networking of the hippocampal subsystem of the DMN was seen in patients with SLE when performing this task, as well as atrophy of the left hippocampus. The present study aimed to search for a structural substrate for the altered recruitment pattern observed in fMRI studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
