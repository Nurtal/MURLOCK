Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. This study aims to derive a more precise estimation on pulse wave velocity (PWV) level in patients with SLE and related factors. A literature search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library databases, studies published up to February 28, 2017, in English. Pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by fixed-effect or random-effect model analysis. Heterogeneity test was performed by the Q statistic and quantified using I2; publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot and Egger's linear regression test. Of 156 studies found, 27 met eligibility criteria, and 14 studies were finally included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed that the SLE group had significantly higher PWV levels than the control group; SMD = 0.56 and 95% CI (0.30-0.82). Subgroup analyses showed that body mass index (BMI), sample size, and disease duration were associated with PWV in patients with SLE. Overall, our study suggests that patients with SLE have a higher PWV level, and it is associated with BMI, sample size, and disease duration.
