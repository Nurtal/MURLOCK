Despite considerable advances in the understanding of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), there is still an urgent need for new and more targeted treatment approaches. We previously demonstrated that small-molecule blockade of G protein βγ subunit (Gβγ) signaling inhibits acute inflammation through inhibition of chemokine receptor signal transduction. We undertook this study to determine whether inhibition of Gβγ signaling ameliorates disease in a mouse model of SLE.
