A number of mouse strains transgenic for B-cell receptors specific for nucleic acids or other autoantigens have been generated to understand how autoreactive B cells are regulated in normal and autoimmune mice. Previous studies of nonautoimmune C57BL/6 mice heterozygous for both the IgH and IgL knockins of the polyreactive autoantibody, 564, produced high levels of autoantibodies in a largely Toll-like receptor 7-dependent manner. Herein, we describe studies of mice homozygous for the knockins that also expressed high levels of autoantibodies but, unlike the heterozygotes, exhibited a high incidence of mature B-cell lymphomas and enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infections. Microarray analyses and serological studies suggested that lymphomagenesis might be related to chronic B-cell activation promoted by IL-21. Strikingly, mice treated continuously with antibiotic-supplemented water did not develop lymphomas or abscesses and exhibited less autoimmunity. This mouse model may help us understand the reasons for enhanced susceptibility to lymphoma development exhibited by humans with a variety of autoimmune diseases, such as Sj√∂gren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and highly active rheumatoid arthritis.
