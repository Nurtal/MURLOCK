Type I interferon (IFN) plays a central role in pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) has been associated with a pathogenic role in lupus nephritis (LN). Thus we investigated whether TWEAK could induce the activation of type I IFN pathway in LN. We examined this in patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as well as MRL/lpr mice, a murine LN model. Relative to the control cohorts, MRL/lpr mice showed severe histological changes, high index levels of renal damage, and elevated expression of type I IFN-inducible genes. After shRNA suppression of TWEAK, we observed that renal damage was significantly attenuated and expression of type I IFN-inducible genes was reduced in MRL/lpr mice. In parallel, siRNA of TWEAK also significantly reduced the expression of type I IFN-inducible genes in PBMCs relative to control transfections. In PBMCs, TWEAK stimulation also led to expression of type I IFN-inducible genes. Our results illustrate a novel regulatory role of TWEAK, in which its activity positively regulates type I IFN pathway in LN based on preclinical models. Our findings suggest TWEAK could act as a critical target in preventing renal damage in patients with LN.
