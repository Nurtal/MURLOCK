B-cell activating factor (BAFF) levels are increased in rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and primary Sj√∂gren's syndrome (pSS). However, BAFF contribution to pathogenesis is not completely understood. In pSS, immune infiltration of the salivary and lacrimal glands leads to xerostomia and xerophtalmia. Glandular B cell hyperactivation, differentiation into germinal center (GC)-like structures and plasma cell accumulation are histopathological hallmarks that were attributed to increased BAFF. Here, we experimentally tested this hypothesis by overexpressing BAFF in a mouse model of pSS. BAFF overexpression enhanced lymphocytic infiltration and MHCII expression on B cells. Increased BAFF also induced B cell differentiation into GC B cells within the autoimmune target tissue. However, even in these conditions, GC B cells only accounted for <1% of glandular B cells, demonstrating that BAFF is not efficiently promoting ectopic GC formation in pSS and warranting further investigation of therapeutics targeting both BAFF and the related TNF-family member APRIL.
