Mechanisms linking innate immunity and autoimmune responses are poorly understood. Myeloid-related protein-8 (Mrp8) and Mrp14 are damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) highly upregulated in various autoimmune disorders. We show in a mouse autoimmune model that local Mrp8 and Mrp14 production is essential for the induction of autoreactive CD8+ T cells and the development of systemic autoimmunity. This effect is mediated via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling leading to increased interleukin-17 (IL-17) expression. Notably, expression of Mrp8 and Mrp14 was upregulated in cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and stimulation of CD8+ T cells from individuals with lupus erythematosus with MRP proteins resulted in an upregulation of IL-17, suggesting a key role for MRP8 and MRP14 for the development of autoreactive lymphocytes during human autoimmunity as well. These results demonstrate a link between local expression of DAMP molecules and the development of systemic autoimmunity.
