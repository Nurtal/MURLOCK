There is a critical need for more noninvasive biomarkers to identify nephritis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Recent studies in a model mouse and an adult SLE patient cohort suggest that anti-basement membrane antibody levels correlate well with lupus activity and kidney injury. The purpose of this study was to assess the anti-basement membrane reactivity in pediatric SLE (pSLE) patients with or without nephritis.
