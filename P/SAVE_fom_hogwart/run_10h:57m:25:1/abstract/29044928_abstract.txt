Recent evidence from genetic, cell biology and model animal studies have suggested a pivotal role of autophagy in mediating systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the genetic basis has not yet been thoroughly examined. The aim of the present study was therefore to identify additional susceptibility variants in autophagy-related genes, and their functional significance.
