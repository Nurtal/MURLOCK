Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multifactorial, autoimmune inflammatory disease with pleomorphic clinical manifestations involving different organs and tissues. The etiology of this disease has been associated with a dysfunctional response of B and T lymphocytes against environmental stimuli in individuals genetically susceptible to SLE, which determines an immune response against different autoantigens and, consequently, tissue damage. The study of different murine models has provided a better understanding of these autoimmune phenomena. This review primarily focuses on that has been learned from the pristane-induced lupus (PIL) model and how this model can be used to supplement recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of SLE. We also consider both current and future therapies for this disease. The PubMed, SciELO, and Embase databases were searched for relevant articles published from 1950 to 2016. PIL has been shown to be a useful tool for understanding the multiple mechanisms involved in systemic autoimmunity. In addition, it can be considered an efficient model to evaluate the environmental contributions and interferon signatures present in patients with SLE.
