The polymorphisms of tumour necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) have been found to associate with several autoimmune diseases. This study aimed to explore the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TNFAIP3 gene with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Han Chinese. Thirty-two SNPs were genotyped in 284 patients with SLE and 630 controls using the ligation detection reaction (LDR) method. The quality control steps and statistical analyses were performed using the PLINK 1.07 package and HAPLOVIEW software. We found that 13 SNPs in TNFAIP3 showed significant association with SLE (P < 1.85 × 10(-3)), and all of them were in high linkage disequilibrium (LD). After conditioning on the SNP rs2230926, other 12 SNPs did not show association (P > 0.27). All 13 SNPs showed most significant association in the dominant model. In haplotype analysis, a long risk SNP haplotype (GCCCGTGTCATGG) showed most significant association (P = 1.00 × 10(-4)). In conclusion, our data suggest that TNFAIP3 is a susceptible gene for SLE in the Han Chinese population.
