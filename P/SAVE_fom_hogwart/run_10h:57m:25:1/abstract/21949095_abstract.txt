Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a polyclonal autoimmune syndrome directed against multiple nuclear autoantigens. Although RNA and DNA seem to have identical immunostimulatory effects on systemic and intrarenal inflammation, each seems to differ with regard to the propensity to induce mitogenic effects such as lymphoproliferation. To identify potential mechanisms by which DNA specifically contributes to the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis, we stimulated cells with immunostimulatory DNA or RNA in vitro and used microarray to compare the transcriptomes of RNA- and DNA-induced genes. Immunostimulatory DNA, but not RNA, induced Mdm2, which is a negative regulator of p53. In vivo, we observed greater expression and activation of Mdm2 in the spleen and kidneys in a mouse model of lupus (MRL-Fas(lpr) mice) than healthy controls. Treatment of MRL-Fas(lpr) mice with the Mdm2 inhibitor nutlin-3a prevented nephritis and lung disease and significantly prolonged survival. Inhibition of Mdm2 reduced systemic inflammation and abrogated immune complex disease by suppressing plasma cells and the production of lupus autoantibodies. In addition, nutlin-3a suppressed the abnormal expansion of all T cell subsets, including CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells, which associated with attenuated systemic inflammation. However, inhibiting Mdm2 did not cause myelosuppression or affect splenic regulatory T cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, or monocytes. Taken together, these data suggest that the induction of Mdm2 promotes the expansion of plasma cells and CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells, which cause autoantibody production and immune complex disease in MRL-Fas(lpr) mice. Antagonizing Mdm2 may have therapeutic potential in lupus nephritis.
