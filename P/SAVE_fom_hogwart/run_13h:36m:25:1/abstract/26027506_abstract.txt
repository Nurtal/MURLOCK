A broad spectrum of inflammatory disorders have the capacity to target the skeleton and to de-regulate the processes of physiological bone remodeling. This review will focus on the systemic inflammatory rheumatologic disorders, which target articular and peri-articular bone tissues. Many of these disorders also affect extra-articular tissues and organs, and in addition, have the capacity to produce systemic bone loss and increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. Attention will focus on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the seronegative spondyloarthropathies (SpAs), which include ankylosing spondylitis (AS), reactive arthritis (formerly designated as Reiter's syndrome), the arthritis of inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile onset spondyloarthropathy and psoriatic arthritis. The discussion will principally focus on RA, which is a prototypical model of an inflammatory disorder that de-regulates bone remodeling, but also will review the other forms of inflammatory joint disease to highlight the differential effects of inflammation on bone remodeling in these conditions.
