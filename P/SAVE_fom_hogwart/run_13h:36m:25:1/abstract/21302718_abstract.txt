During the last three decades scientists worldwide have investigated how ultraviolet radiation (UVR) influences the immune system. The vast majority of the researchers was primarily focused on the local immunomodulatory role of UVR. But today evidence is increasing in favor of plural immune activation and systemic reaction of the organism. Most of the attention is directed toward the regulatory T lymphocytes which are responsible for the local and systemic immunosuppressive response under the impact of sunlight. The role of regulatory T cells in autoimmune diseases is well studied on patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Epidemiological research shows a proportional interdependence of latitude and prevalence of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There is evidence that UVR has direct influence on the level of antibodies against the SNF2-superfamily helicase (Mi-2), distinctive for dermatomyositis (DM). On this basis a hypothesis is established that UVR is a risk factor for DM. A Croatian epidemiologic study o f systemic sclerosis (SSc) gave results consistent with the hypothesis that there is a higher prevalence of SSc in the Mediterranean regions of Croatia. Such discoveries encouraged further studies that found that not only regulatory T cells are responsible for a systemic immunosuppressive response, but that there is a complex interactive network of immune cells and mediators such as cytokines, neuropeptides, and chromophores like urocanic acid involved. Present findings require continued research on the importance of UVR on autoimmune disease prevalence and immunopathophysiology. Finally, it is necessary to distinguish whether UVR is a protective factor for some autoimmune diseases or a risk factor for their induction.
