Sjögren's syndrome (SjS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are common systemic autoimmune diseases, which impact not only patient health but also their quality of life. miRNA-146a is a microRNA that participates in the pathophysiology of SjS and SLE. In this investigation, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine the relationship of miR-146a to primary SjS (PSS) and to SLE. The following databases were interrogated; Pubmed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, WANFANG, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and WEIPU. Standard mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to study the relationship between miRNA-146a expression and thee diseases by random-effects model. A total of six studies, with 158 cases and 124 controls were included for the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis shows that miRNA-146a expression is associated with the risk of PSS (MD = 6.32, p = 0.005). No relationship between miR-146a expression and SLE was identified (MD = -0.86, p = 0.26). SLE subgroup analysis (peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum) confirmed this result. The risk for PSS is related to miR-146a expression, while miRNA-146a expression is not related to SLE. As such, miRNA-146a may serve as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of PSS, but not SLE.
