Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune syndrome associated with organ damage and an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease resulting from activation of both innate and adaptive immune pathways. Recently, increased activation of the inflammasome machinery in SLE has been described. Using the mouse model of pristane-induced lupus, we undertook this study to explore whether caspase 1, the central enzyme of the inflammasome, plays a role in the development of SLE and its associated vascular dysfunction.
