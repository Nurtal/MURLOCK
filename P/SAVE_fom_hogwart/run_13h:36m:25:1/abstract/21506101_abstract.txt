Type II collagen (CII)-specific B cell responses have been recognized in human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). An important limitation of the CIA model is that the CII response and the disease are stimulated by exogenously injected collagen. A model of experimental ovalbumin (OVA)-mediated acute arthritis has been established in which autoimmunity is spontaneous and elicited by antigen-specific T cells. This study was undertaken to create a new model of chronic autoimmune polyarthritis and characterize the associated CII-specific B cell response.
