The aim of this study was to determine whether the functional HLA-G 14 bp insertion (I)/deletion (D) and +3142 G/C polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A meta-analysis was conducted on the associations between the HLA-G 14 bp I/D, and +3142 G/C polymorphisms and SLE or RA using; (1) allele contrast, (2) the recessive model, (3) the dominant model, and (4) additive model. A total of 14 comparison studies from 11 articles met our inclusion criteria, comprising eight on SLE (1,284 patients and 1,885 controls) and four on RA (820 patients and 772 controls), and three studies investigated response to methotrexate (MTX) in RA according to the HLA-G 14 bp I/D polymorphisms (249 responders and 205 nonresponders). Meta-analysis revealed an association between the II + ID genotype of the HLA-G 14 bp I/D polymorphism in overall group (OR = 1.205, 95% CI = 1.036-1.403, P = 0.016). Ethnicity-specific meta-analysis showed no association between the II + ID genotype and SLE in the South American, European, and Asian population. Meta-analysis revealed a significant association between SLE and the HLA-G +3142 G allele in all study subjects (OR = 1.367, 95% CI = 1.158-1.613, P = 2.2 × 10(-5)) and in the South American group (OR = 1.531, 95% CI = 1.242-1.888, P = 6.7 × 10(-5)). However, no association between HLA-G 14 bp I/D, and +3142 G/C polymorphisms and RA was found (OR for HLA-G I allele = 1.013, 95 % CI = 0.879-1.167, P = 0.859; OR for +3142 G allele = 0.980, 95% CI = 0.742-1.294, P = 0.888). Furthermore, HLA-G 14 bp I/D polymorphism was not found to be associated with response to MTX in RA. This meta-analysis demonstrates that the HLA-G 14 bp I/D polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to SLE, and HLA-G +3142 G/C polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to SLE in South Americans.
