Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies against a host of nuclear antigens. The pathogenesis of lupus is incompletely understood. Environmental factors may play a role via altering DNA methylation, a mechanism regulating gene expression. In lupus, genes including CD11a and CD70 are overexpressed in T cells as a result of promoter hypomethylation. T-cell DNA methyltransferase expression is regulated in part by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. In this study, we investigate the effects of decreased ERK pathway signaling in T cells using transgenic animals. We generated a transgenic mouse that inducibly expresses a dominant-negative MEK in T cells in the presence of doxycycline. We show that decreased ERK pathway signaling in T cells results in decreased expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 and overexpression of the methylation-sensitive genes CD11a and CD70, similar to T cells in human lupus. Our transgenic animal model also develops anti-dsDNA antibodies. Interestingly, microarray expression assays revealed overexpression of several interferon-regulated genes in the spleen similar to peripheral blood cells of lupus patients. This model supports the contention that ERK pathway signaling defects in T cells contribute to the development of autoimmunity.
