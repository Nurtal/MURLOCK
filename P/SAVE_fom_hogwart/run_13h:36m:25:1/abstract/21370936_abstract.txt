Induction of immune tolerance as therapeutic approach for autoimmune diseases constitutes a current research focal point. In this sense, we aimed to evaluate an altered peptide ligand (APL) for induction of peripheral tolerance in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A novel T-cell epitope from human heat-shock protein 60 (Hsp60), an autoantigen involved in the pathogenesis of RA, was identified by bioinformatics tools and an APL was design starting from this epitope. We investigated the ability of this APL for inducing regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in mice and evaluated the therapeutic effect of this peptide in an adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) rat model. Clinical score, TNFα levels and histopathology were monitored, as well as the capacity of this APL for inducing Treg cells. Finally, the potentialities of the APL for inducing Treg cells were evaluated in ex vivo assays using mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood (PBMC). The APL induced an increase of the proportions of Treg cells in the draining lymph nodes of the injected site in mice. The APL efficiently inhibited the course of AA, with significant reduction of the clinical and histopathology score. This effect was associated with an increase of the proportions of Treg cells and a decrease of TNFα levels in spleen. Finally, stimulation of PBMCs from RA patients by the APL increases the proportions of the CD4(+)CD25(high)FoxP3(+) Treg cells. These results indicate a therapeutic potentiality of APL and support further investigation of this candidate drug for treatment of RA.
