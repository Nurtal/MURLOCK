Despite considerable efforts, the molecular and cellular events in lacrimal gland tissues initiating inflammatory responses leading to keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), autoimmunity, and Sj√∂gren's syndrome (SjS) have yet to be defined. To determine whether altered glandular homeostasis occurs before the onset of autoimmunity, a temporal transcriptome study was carried out in an animal model of primary SjS.
