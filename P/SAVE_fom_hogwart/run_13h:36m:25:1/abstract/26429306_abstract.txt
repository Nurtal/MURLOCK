Dendritic cell immunoreceptor (DCIR) has previously shown an association with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Caucasians and Han Chinese. This study was aimed to further investigate whether DCIR polymorphisms are novel susceptibility factors for other autoimmune diseases, i.e. systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS). A total of 1502 patients with SLE, 476 patients with primary SS, and 1278 non-related healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2377422 and rs10840759 were genotyped using TaqMan assay. The differences in allelic and genotypic distribution between two groups were assessed using Pearson chi-square test, and logistic regression adjusting for age and sex, respectively. P-value < 0.025 was considered statistically significant by Bonferroni correction. The SNP rs2377422 confers an increased susceptibility risk to both SLE (allele model: P = 7.65 × 10(-4), OR 1.20; genotype recessive model: P = 0.012, OR 1.29), and primary SS (allele model: P = 3.74 × 10(-4), OR 1.31; genotype dominant model: P = 1.62 × 10(-4), OR 2.02). There is no association between rs10840759 and SLE or primary SS. In conclusion, DCIR SNP rs2377422 is a novel genetic susceptibility factor for both SLE and primary SS.
