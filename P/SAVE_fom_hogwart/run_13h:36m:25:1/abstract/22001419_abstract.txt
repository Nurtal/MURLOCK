Regulatory T cells play an important role in the maintenance and regulation of immune tolerance and in the prevention of autoimmunity. Recent studies have demonstrated a deficiency in number and function of regulatory T cells in lupus and other autoimmune diseases. This may contribute to immune dysregulations and a defect in self-tolerance mechanisms. How to balance and "reset" the immune response from harmful pro-inflammatory to beneficial anti-inflammatory is the current strategy of the research. In this regard, several studies have been performed with various peptides, drugs, steroids and epigenetic agents to induce or modify regulatory cells and some measure of success has been achieved in the animal model of SLE and with lupus patient cells. Challenges ahead include the heterogeneous nature, phenotype and function of regulatory cells and the difficulties in manipulation of regulatory function in healthy versus diseased states. In this review, we will provide some recent findings indicating challenges and potential benefits of targeting of regulatory T cells in lupus.
