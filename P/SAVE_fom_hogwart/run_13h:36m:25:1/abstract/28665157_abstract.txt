MRL/MpJ-Faslpr (lpr) mice are a model for autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These diseases mainly affect women, with a 10:1 female-to-male ratio, and cause pleuropulmonary lesions. We previously revealed a correlation between mediastinal fat-associated lymphoid cluster (MFALC) development and cellular infiltration in the lungs of lpr male mice; however, we did not report on MFALCs in females. The purpose of this investigation was to reveal sex-related differences in MFALCs in lpr mice. We compared the morphological features of MFALCs and lung mononuclear cell aggregates (LMCAs) in 5-month-old male and female lpr mice. The females showed significantly elevated anti-dsDNA autoantibody titers and larger MFALCs, with a higher ratio of lymphatic vessel (LV) and high endothelial venule (HEV) areas to MFALC area, and greater numbers of T- and B-cells, macrophages, and proliferating and dendritic cells in MFALCs and LMCAs than males. Our data indicated that MFALCs were more developed and lung lesions were more severe in female than in male lpr mice, thereby suggesting a potential role for LVs and HEVs in the establishment of MFALCs and lung lesions. Further investigation in female lpr mice will be needed for treatment of human respiratory diseases and autoimmune disorders.
