Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease caused by loss of immunologic self tolerance and characterized by chronic joint inflammation. Cells isolated from human amniotic membrane (HAMCs) were recently found to display immunosuppressive properties. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of HAMCs on antigen-specific T cell responses in RA patients and to evaluate their therapeutic potential in a preclinical experimental model of RA.
