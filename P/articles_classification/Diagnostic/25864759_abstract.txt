Joint detection of anti-dsDNA antibodies, anti-U1RNP, anti-SM antibodies, anti-SSA antibodies, anti-ribosomal P protein antibodies, anti-nucleosome antivodies (Anua), anti-histone antibodies (AHA) and antinuclear antibodies brings to the early diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and speculation of renal lesion degree of lupus nephritis patients in order to choose a specific therapeutic schedule. This paper analyzed the abnormal immunology features and connections of each pathological pattern of LN renal biopsy and probed into the essence in order to provide basis for diagnosis, treatment, pathological pattern speculation and forward assessment of LN. We chose 97 cases, treated them with renal biopsy and pathological pattern classification, analyzed pathological pattern distribution, different pathological patterns and the correlation of immunity index with anti-dsDNA antibodies, anti-U1RNP, anti-Sm antibodies, anti-SSA antibodies, anti-ribosomal P protein antibodies, Anua, AHA and ANA of the first renal biopsy were taken as the experiment index. The results showed that the morbidity of the male was distinctly lower than the female and the age of onset was much lower (P < 0.05); pattern I, pattern II, pattern III, pattern IV, pattern V, and pattern VI accounted for 1.0%, 3.1%, 12.4%, 47.4%,16.5%, 15.5%, 4.1%, 0%,respectively; among all the LN patients, there were respectively 59, 43, 28, 52, 51, 48, 36 and 93 cases in which anti-dsDNA antibody, anti-U1RNP antibody, anti-Sm antibody, anti-SSA antibody, anti-ribosomal P protein antibodies, Anua, AHA and ANA had increased and the positive rate was 60.8%, 44.3%, 28.9%, 53.6%, 52.6%, 49.5%, 37.1% and 95.9%, respectively. In conclusion, pattern IV is the most common of all pathological patterns of LN. Among the immunity index, anti- U1RNP antibodies and anti-SSA antibodies are positively correlated with anti-dsDNA antibodies; Anua is positively correlated with anti-dsDNA antibodies and AHA; anti-dsDNA antibodies, anti U1RNP antibodies, anti-Sm antibodies, anti SSA antibodies, AHA, anti-ribosomal P protein antibodies and ANA have no obvious correlation with LN renal lesions degree; Anua level of serum is positively correlated with LN renal lesions degree.
