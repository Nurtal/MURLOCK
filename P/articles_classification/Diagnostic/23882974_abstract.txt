The purpose of was to evaluate the renal pathology findings as described by the World Health Organization classification for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a group of Puerto Rico patients with lupus nephritis and determine the association with clinical and laboratory findings. The medical records from patients seen at the Lu pus Clinic from 1985 to 2005 were reviewed and patients with a performed renal biopsy included. All patients fulfilled the American ColIege of Rheumatology criteria for SLE. Data gathered from the medical records included demographics, cumulative clinical manifestations and serologic tests at the time of the renal biopsy. There were 139 patients with lupus nephntis (LN) and 71 patients (51%) had a renal biopsy done. From these 86% were females and their mean age at LN diagnosis was 25 years. The mean time between diagnosis of LN and renal biopsy was 1.5 years. The most frequent renal pathology was membranous glomewlonephritis (GN) class V (37%) followed by mesangial GN class II (23%). All groups were similar in clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters. The majority of Puerto Rico patients with LN had membranous GN class V. This data is different from other ethnic groups were diffuse GN type IV has been described as most prevalent.
