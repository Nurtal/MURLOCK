Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder with complex genetic underpinnings. This review attempts to assemble the myriad of genomic findings to build a clearer picture of the pathobiology of SLE to serve as a guide for therapeutics. Over 100 genes are now known for SLE, and several more penetrant ones have led to the emergence of more defined lupus phenotypes. Also discussed here are the targeted therapies that have come up on the horizon and the specific biologic mechanisms of more traditional therapies which have only recently been explored. The diagnostic toolbox has been enhanced by the addition of new antibodies, gene expression signatures, and mutation panels. This provides an opportunity to piece together the lupus puzzle and even revisit the clinical classification of SLE.
