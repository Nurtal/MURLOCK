There is no definition or guidelines for refractory disease (RD) in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). However, new therapies have been tested mainly in refractory patients. The concept, like the disease, is complex and implies deeper knowledge on the disease pathogenesis and patients' subsets. RD is not included in current activity indices of the disease, what raises the question of how are we monitoring its response to new drugs. In this paper, we analyse some concepts considered important for the global definition of RD in SLE and in some specific organ involvements, excluding lupus nephritis. Management issues will be addressed also. Finally, we review therapeutic options in particular subsets of the disease, namely, cutaneous, articular, haematological and neuropsychiatric lupus. Crucial to the management of a patient suspected to be refractory is an accurate diagnosis, assuring that the persistent clinical manifestations are derived primarily from SLE and not from a concomitant or alternative process. Likewise, certainty about the patient compliance with the therapy prescribed is a frequent unrecognized problem that erroneously might lead to a classification of RD. Therapy of RD for SLE, in general and in most particular involvements, is currently based mainly on the clinician's own experience and judgement, with few randomized trials effectively addressing the issue. In such a heterogeneous disease, consideration of approval of drugs for single-organ indications may pave the way for new therapies. Better biomarkers are needed to add accuracy to the currently used activity indices in order to monitor RD and consolidate its definition. Prospective studies directed to RD in the main SLE involvements are needed to improve our understanding on the management of the disease and foster the development of targeted new drugs.
