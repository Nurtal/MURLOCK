Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a well identified cause of mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients due to an accelerated premature atherosclerosis. We investigated the proportion of comorbid IHD among SLE patients derived from a large, national real-life database. Using data from the largest HMO in Israel, the Clalit Health Services, we selected for patients with SLE. These patients were compared with age and sex matched controls with regards to the proportion of IHD in a case-control study. Chi-square and t tests were used for univariate analysis, and a logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. The study included 5018 patients with SLE and 25090 age and sex-frequency matched controls. The prevalence of IHD in patients with SLE was increased in comparison to controls (11.3 and 3.1%, P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, SLE was associated with IHD (OR 3.77, 95% confidence interval 3.34-4.26). We have confirmed that SLE patients suffer a high prevalence of IHD. Our data supports that SLE is an independent risk factor for IHD. When evaluating by gender, the risk seems even more substantial in females. No significant difference was found in the risk of IHD in SLE among the difference socioeconomic strata.
