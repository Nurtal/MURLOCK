Lichen planus (LP) is a chronic inflammatory mucocutaneous disorder with unknown etiology. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is known as a prototypic autoimmune disease. Cytokines play a key role in the pathogenesis of both diseases. Various cytokines, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10), interferon alpha (INF-a), and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-a) can serve as biomarkers to predict SLE severity and monitor disease activity. In this review, we compare interleukins in oral lichen planus and lupus erythematosus as an autoimmune disease prototype. So, this review may provide insight for researchers in completing the cytokine network in OLP. Among the etiologic factors, the imbalance between Th-1 and Th-2 cytokine production plays an important role in the development of both diseases. By understanding cytokines and immunoregulatory networks of cytokines in these patients, appropriate treatment can be offered. There are many limitations in cytokine studies, which we have described in this article.
