The standard approaches to analyzing emphysema in computed tomography (CT) images are visual inspection and the relative area of voxels below a threshold (RA). The former approach is subjective and impractical in a large data set and the latter relies on a single threshold and independent voxel information, ignoring any spatial correlation in intensities. In recent years, supervised learning on texture features has been investigated as an alternative to these approaches, showing good results. However, supervised learning requires labeled samples, and these samples are often obtained via subjective and time consuming visual scoring done by human experts. In this work, we investigate the possibility of applying supervised learning using texture measures on random CT samples where the labels are based on external, non-CT measures. We are not targeting emphysema directly, instead we focus on learning textural differences that discriminate subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from healthy smokers, and it is expected that emphysema plays a major part in this. The proposed texture based approach achieves an 69% classification accuracy which is significantly better than RA's 55% accuracy.
