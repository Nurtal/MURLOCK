Over 10 years have passed since the latest revision of the histopathologic classification of lupus nephritis. This revision was a significant improvement compared with the previous version, mainly because of clearer and more concise definitions and the elimination of mixed subclasses. Despite these improvements, there are still some difficulties in the classification for lupus nephritis, many of which are in the definitions provided. In this review, we focus on the difficulties surrounding the evaluation of classes III and IV lesions, particularly the definitions of endocapillary and extracapillary proliferation, the use of the terms endocapillary proliferation and hypercellularity, the clinical relevance of segmental and global subdivision in class IV, and the value of distinguishing lesions that indicate activity and chronicity. Vascular and tubulointerstitial lesions are also discussed. Furthermore, we give an overview of the history of the classification to provide background on the origin and development of the definitions in lupus nephritis. The issues raised in this review as well as the suggestions for improvements may assist with a revision of the lupus nephritis classification in the near future.
