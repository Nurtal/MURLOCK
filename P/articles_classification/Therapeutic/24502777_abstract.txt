Self-specific B cells play a main role in the pathogenesis of lupus. This autoimmune disease is characterized by the generation of autoantibodies against self antigens, and the elimination of B and T cells involved in the pathological immune response is a logical approach for effective therapy. We have previously constructed a chimeric molecule by coupling a DNA-mimotope peptides to an anti-CD32 antibody. Using this protein molecule for the treatment of lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice, we suppressed selectively the autoreactive B-lymphocytes by cross-linking B cell receptors with the inhibitory FcÎ³RIIb receptors. This approach was limited by the development of anti-chimeric antibodies in MRL mice. In order to avoid this problem, we established a murine severe combined immunodeficiency lupus model, allowing a long-term chimera therapy. Elimination of the double-stranded DNA-specific B cells by chimera therapy in MRL-transferred immunodeficient mice resulted in inhibition of T cell proliferation and prevented the appearance of IgG anti-DNA antibodies and of proteinuria.
