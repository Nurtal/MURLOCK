Numerous reports have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are implicated in immuno-regulation. Several factors expressed from MSCs, especially indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), are of importance in immuno-regulation on immune cells. In current minireview, we provided evidences to support a novel notion that MSCs may be a major source of "safe signals" in the immune system to balance "dangerous signals" based on a well accepted theory of "danger model". Furthermore, MSCs are of lifecycle characterized by age-and diseased-related changes, such as decreased growth rate, increased senescence, and altered morphology. Thus, defected and abnormal MSCs are implicated in auto-immune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Clinically, it is important to determine clinical benefits and sides effects of cell therapies using autologous self-MSCs or healthy allogeneic MSCs in treatment of autoimmune diseases.
