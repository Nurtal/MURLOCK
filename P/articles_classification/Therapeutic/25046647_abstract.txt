Oxidative stress (OS) is important in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and its experimental model--adjuvant arthritis (AA). Antioxidants are scarcely studied in autoimmunity, and future analyses are needed to assess its effects in ameliorating these diseases. Although there are studies about antioxidants effects on the course of RA, their role in combination therapy has not yet been studied in detail, especially on extra-articular manifestations of AA. During the 28-d administration of pinosylvin (PIN) in monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate (MTX) to AA rats, we evaluated the impact of the treatment on selected parameters. The experiment included: healthy controls, untreated AA, AA administered 50 mg/kg b.w. of PIN daily p.o., AA administered 0.4 mg/kg b.w. of MTX twice weekly p.o. and AA treated with a combination of PIN+MTX. AA was monitored using: hind paw volume, C-reactive protein, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and F2-isoprostanes in plasma, γ-glutamyltransferase activity in spleen, activity of lipoxygenase (LOX) in lung, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in liver and lung. PIN monotherapy significantly improved the activation of NF-κB in liver and lung, HO-1 expression and activity of LOX in the lung, MCP-1 levels in plasma (on 14th d) and plasmatic levels of F2-isoprostanes. An important contribution of PIN to MTX effect was the reduction of OS (an increase of HO-1 expression in lung and reduction of plasmatic TBARS) and decrease of LOX activity in the lung.
