Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease. Autoantibodies (autoAbs) against double-stranded DNA (ds DNA), the hallmark of lupus, are produced and maintained by the interaction between auto-reactive B cells and CD4+ T cells. This interplay is controlled by the CD28/CD80-86/CTLA-4 axis. Here we investigated whether selective blockade of CD28-CD80/86 co-stimulatory interactions abrogates lupus nephritis development in a murine model of SLE. To this aim, NZB/NZW F1 mice were treated for 3 months, either with an anti-CD28 Fab' fragment or a control Fab'-IgG. The effect of CD28 blockade on lupus nephritis onset, survival, production of anti-ds DNA antibodies and costimulatory molecules was evaluated. CD28 blockade prevented the development of lupus nephritis and prolonged survival during the 3-month treatment and 12 weeks after. Furthermore, the production of anti-ds DNA autoAbs was decreased. Lastly, the protective effect of CD28 blockade was associated with increased intrarenal expression of the immunoregulatory molecule, Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase, of the co-inhibitory receptor programmed cell-Death - 1 (PD-1) and of its ligand programmed death ligand - 1 (PDL-1).In conclusion, CD28 blockade prevented the development of lupus nephritis in NZB/NZW F1 mice. This immunomodulatory strategy is a promising candidate for SLE therapy in humans.
