Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the prototype of complex autoimmune diseases characterized by the production of autoantibodies which results in widespread immunologic abnormalities and immune complex formation. The underlying etiology remains largely unknown. When progressing toward kidney failure, it is becoming a serious public health problem. Kidney transplantation is a feasible therapy, but significant limitations were existed, including shortage of donor organs and lack of funding. To find an alternative proposal for kidney replacement, the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology was adopted. We identified typical SLE patients. Lentiviral transduction of OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC, under feeder conditions, resulted in reprogramming of urine-derived renal tubular cells. We investigated the viability of iPSCs generation from patients with SLE by identification of totipotency and pluripotency. SLE patient renal tubular cells-derived iPSCs exhibited properties of human embryonic stem cells, including morphology, growth properties, alkaline phosphatase, expression of pluripotency, genes and surface markers, and teratoma formation. We demonstrated that generation of SLE-specific iPSCs from urine was not only the first time worldwide, but was feasible and efficient. IPSCs from SLE would provide convenient model to study disease pathogenesis, drugs screening, and gene therapy.
