Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune-mediated chronic inflammatory disease. Half of patients with SLE suffer from lupus nephritis, which is major cause of death in SLE. TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK)/fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) interactions mediate inflammatory responses that are linked to the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis. Blocking of the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway by Fn14-Fc was performed in a SLE mouse model and the likely therapeutic mechanisms were investigated.
