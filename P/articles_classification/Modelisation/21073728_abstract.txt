The use of mouse models to study human disease provides useful data that can provide support for research projects or an existing drug discovery program. How well a model recapitulates the human condition and the ease and reproducibility of data collected will determine how much confidence a scientist can place on results obtained. Designing new treatments for rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), requires complex immunocompetent models that depend on intricate cytokine networks. Using local cytokines, signal transduction and transcription factor molecules as potential biomarkers to monitor disease and treatment efficacy is the best method to follow the progression of tissue damage and repair when testing an unknown compound or biologic. Described here in this report, a novel method for the non-enzymatic extraction and measurement of cytokines and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) molecules using LuminexÂ® bead array technology in two different mouse models for human RA--collagen antibody-dependent arthritis (CAIA) and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).
