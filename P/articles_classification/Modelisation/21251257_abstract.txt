Marginal zone B cells have been implicated in the production of autoantibodies in murine models of lupus. It has been suggested that they contribute to lupus immunopathogenesis through their enhanced effector functions and their repertoire that is biased toward autoreactive specificities. In the B6.NZM2410.Sle.Sle2.Sle3 (B6.TC) model of lupus, the majority of marginal zone B cells are located outside the marginal zone and inside the follicles. Genetic alterations of this strain have shown a correlation between autoimmune pathogenesis and the presence of intrafollicular marginal zone B cells. This study was designed first to strengthen our original observations and to determine how the marginal zone B cells from the lupus-prone mice respond to stimulations and interact with T cells.
