Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disorder with prevalent hypertension and renal injury. In this study, we tested whether the renal nerves contribute to the development of hypertension in an established mouse model of SLE (NZBWF1). Female SLE and control (NZW/LacJ) mice were subjected to either bilateral renal denervation or a sham procedure at 32 wk of age. Two weeks later, blood pressure was assessed in conscious mice using carotid artery catheters. Blood pressure was higher in SLE mice compared with controls, as previously reported; however, blood pressure was not altered in the denervated SLE or control mice. The development of albuminuria was markedly blunted in denervated SLE mice; however, glomerulosclerosis was increased. Renal denervation reduced renal cortical expression of monocyte-chemoattractant protein in SLE mice but did not significantly alter renal monocyte/macrophage infiltration. Renal cortical TNF-Î± expression was also increased in sham SLE mice, but this was not impacted by denervation. This study suggests that the renal nerves do not have a significant role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, but have a complex effect on the associated renal inflammation and renal injury.
