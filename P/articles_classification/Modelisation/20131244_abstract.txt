In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the joint inflammation referred to as Jaccoud's arthritis that occurs in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is nonerosive. Although the mechanism responsible is unknown, the antiosteoclastogenic cytokine interferon-alpha (IFNalpha), whose transcriptome is present in SLE monocytes, may be responsible. This study was undertaken to examine the effects of IFNalpha and lupus on osteoclasts and erosion in the (NZB x NZW)F(1) mouse model of SLE with K/BxN serum-induced arthritis.
