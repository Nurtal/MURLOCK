Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypical autoimmune disease characterized by various clinical manifestations. Several cytokines interact and play pathological roles in SLE, although the etiopathology is still obscure. In the present study we investigated the network of immune response-related molecules expressed in the peripheral blood of SLE patients, and the effects of cytokine interactions on the regulation of these molecules.
