Regulatory B cells are now recognized as an essential component of the immune system. The function of regulatory B cells is dependent on IL-10. The cell-surface phenotype of murine IL-10-producing regulatory B cells is reported to be CD1d(hi)CD5(+) B cell or CD21(hi)CD23(hi) T2 marginal zone precursor B cells. B cells play several critical roles in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is now apparent that regulatory B cells are important for disease suppression in SLE. Regulatory B cells inhibit disease onset of NZB/W F1 mice, a spontaneous SLE mouse model. Furthermore, the potential therapeutic effect of regulatory B cells in NZB/W F1 mice is highlighted by the adoptive transfer of splenic CD1d(hi)CD5(+) B cells. Regulatory B cells also suppress the disease manifestation in MRL-Fas(lpr) mice, a SLE mouse model. Thus, regulatory B cells have protective role and therapeutic effects in mouse modes of SLE. Herein, the methods for evaluating SLE mouse model, B-cell depletion, and regulatory B-cell analysis are provided. These methods should facilitate the study of regulatory B cells in SLE.
