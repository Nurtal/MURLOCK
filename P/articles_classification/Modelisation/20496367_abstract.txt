Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are multipotent cells characterized by immunomodulatory properties and are therefore considered a promising tool for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. This study was undertaken to assess the influence of murine BM-MSCs on the activation of B cells in (NZB Ã— NZW)F(1) mice as an animal model of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
