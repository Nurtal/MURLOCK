Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that predominately affects women of reproductive age. Hypertension is an important cardiovascular risk factor that is prevalent in this patient population. Despite the high incidence of hypertension in women with SLE, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of hypertension remain poorly understood. This review will focus on disease-related factors, including inflammation, autoantibodies, and sex hormones that may contribute to hypertension in patients with SLE. In addition, we will highlight studies performed by our laboratory using the female NZBWF1 (F1 hybrid of New Zealand Black and New Zealand White strains) mouse model, a spontaneous model of SLE that mimics human disease and develops hypertension and renal injury. Specifically, using female NZBWF1 mice, we have demonstrated that multiple factors contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension, including the inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, oxidative stress, as well as B-cell hyperactivity and autoantibody production.
