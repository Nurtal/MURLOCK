Traditional classification of hyperlipidemia using high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and very low-density lipoprotein does not provide information on lipoprotein function. Apolipoproteins (Apos), which are protein components of plasma lipoproteins (including A, B, C, D, E) with their different composition, metabolic, and atherogenic properties, provide insight on lipoprotein functioning. In particular, the Apo B/A-I ratio is associated with atherogenic LDL and development of cardiovascular disease. We explored the baseline association between these nontraditional risk factors with subclinical measures of atherosclerosis (coronary artery calcification [CAC] and carotid intima-media thickness [IMT]) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
