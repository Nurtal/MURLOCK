Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease, with heterogeneous presentation. The aim of this study was to examine the association of a single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs7396562, of the interferon induced with single immunoglobulin IL-1-related receptor (SIGIRR) gene with SLE in a Chinese population. A total of 741 SLE patients and 731 healthy control subjects were enrolled in the present study. The genotyping of polymorphism (rs7396562) was determined by TaqMan allele discrimination assay on the 7,300 real-time polymerase chain reaction system. The frequency of T allele for rs7396562 in patients was significantly higher than in controls (T versus G, OR=1.318, 95 % confidence interval (CI)=1.139-1.525, P<0.001). Fortunately, some significant difference in genotype distribution was found between cases and controls (P<0.001). We also found some significant evidence for the association of the SIGIRR rs7396562 polymorphism with SLE between dominant and recessive model (TG+TT versus GG, P=0.002; TT versus TG+GG, P=0.002). We also analyzed the association of the SIGIRR rs7396562 T allele with clinical features; luckily, photosensitivity and malar rash had some significant signal with the SNP. In conclusion, our study represents the first report demonstrating an association of the SIGIRR rs7396562 polymorphism with SLE susceptibility in a Chinese population.
