Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects about 1% of the adult population and occurs twice as frequently among women than men. At present it is accepted that pathogenesis of RA is based on inflammatory response mediated by CD4(+) Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes. The most commonly applied model imitating RA is the collagen induced arthritis (CIA). A growing evidence shows that there is a correlation between microbial dysbiosis and human pathology which includes autoimmunity, allergic diseases, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), metabolic syndrome.
