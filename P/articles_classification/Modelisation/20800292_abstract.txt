Emotional disturbances are among the most common neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE, a systemic autoimmune disease with a strong female predominance. In this study, we evaluated young MRL/lpr mice, directly comparing males and females. MRL/lpr females exhibited significant depression as early as 5 weeks (at which time elevated levels of autoantibodies were already present), as compared to MRL/lpr males, where depression was noted only at 18 weeks. Depression was significantly correlated with autoantibodies against nuclear antigens, NMDA receptor, and ribosomal P. Our results are consistent with a primary role of autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of early neuropsychiatric deficits in this lupus model, which translate into gender-based differences in clinical phenotype.
