The effect of infection in initiating autoimmune disease has been debated for many years. There are, even now, few instances of a human autoimmune disease clearly caused by prior infection, probably due to the frequent separation in time and space from the clinical outcomes. As our understanding of the immunologic consequences of the infectious process has deepened, we can re-think some of the issues by focusing attention on the varied adjuvant effects of microbial products. We are now able to distinguish some of the critical steps in progression from virus infection to benign autoimmunity to autoimmune disease in an experimental model of myocarditis. Immune regulators, such as cytokines and costimulatory molecules, serve as signposts in the process. The lessons learned may be broadly applicable to autoimmune disorders.
