Neonatal lupus syndrome is considered a model of passively acquired autoimmune disease. The first 10 newborns born to mothers with connective tissue disease and positive for anti-SSA/Ro antibodies enrolled in a follow-up program to evaluate the incidence of cardiac, hepatobiliary, hematologic, echoencephalographic, and cutaneous manifestations until 9 months of age are described in this study. No congenital heart block was observed, but only transient rhythm alterations were observed. In all, 1 infant showed typical neonatal lupus syndrome skin lesions at 3 months of age. During the neonatal period, echoencephalographic alterations were found more frequently, whereas at follow-up, hepatic and hematologic alterations were more often observed. In all, 1 baby showed persistent neutropenia. A standard program that enrolls all infants born to mothers with anti-SSA/Ro autoantibodies, who are at risk of developing neonatal lupus syndrome, should also include tests performed some time after birth, as a number of clinical manifestations might appear at a late stage.
