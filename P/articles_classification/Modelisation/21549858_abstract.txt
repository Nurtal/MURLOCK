Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease accompanying excessive inflammatory responses in a wide range of organs. Abnormal activation of p38 MAPK has been postulated to contribute to the inflammation of SLE, leading to progressive tissue and organ damages to develop lupus nephritis and autoimmune hepatitis. In order to determine whether p38 MAPK inhibitor is effective in mouse model of SLE, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK SB203580 was orally administrated to MRL/lpr mice aged from 14 to 22 weeks. Renal and hepatic functions, as well as pathologic changes of important organs including kidney, liver and spleen of MRL/lpr mice were evaluated. As a result, we showed that SB203580 improved renal function by decreasing the levels of proteinuria and serum BUN, ameliorating the pathologic changes of kidney and reducing Ig and C(3) depositions in the kidney. Hepatocytes necrosis, recruitment and proliferation of leucocytes in liver and spleen were found to be inhibited by administration of SB203580. Therefore, p38 MAPK activation may be partially responsible for escalating autoimmune renal, hepatic and splenic destruction, and its inhibitor may lighten the autoimmune attack in these important organs and improve renal function. Our study reveals that the selective blockade of p38 MAPK is effective to prevent and treat the disease in this model of SLE.
