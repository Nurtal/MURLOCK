Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease that is driven in part by chronic B and T lymphocyte hyperresponsiveness to self antigens. A deficiency of interleukin-21 (IL-21) or IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) in mice dramatically reduces inflammation and B and T cell activation in models of autoimmunity, including SLE. However, whether IL-21 is essential for the maintenance and amplification of preestablished inflammation has not been widely examined in various animal models. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of novel mouse IL-21R neutralizing antibodies on recall responses to antigen challenge and on disease progression in the (NZB Ã— NZW)F1 (NZB/NZW) mouse model of SLE.
