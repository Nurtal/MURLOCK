Considerable efforts have been deployed over the years to decipher the genetic basis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The NZM2410 strain is murine model in which the genetic analysis of SLE is the most advanced. NZM2410 studies have shown that, as in SLE patients, lupus susceptibility is achieved by the coexpression of many susceptibility alleles, each of which with a small contribution to the overall disease phenotype. This mouse model has also revealed the critical role played by gene-gene interactions, which are believed to be an essential contribution to human SLE heritability, although it has been much more difficult to characterize. We have now reached a phase in which NZM2410 susceptibility genes have been identified, all them novel in their association with lupus or even with immune functions. Ongoing studies geared at understanding how these genes impact immune tolerance and interact with each other in the mouse, and their impact on the human immune system or target organs, will undoubtedly lead to important discovery for a better understanding on the disease and potential identification of therapeutic targets.
