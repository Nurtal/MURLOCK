We have previously shown that both short- and long-lived plasma cells (PCs) significantly contribute to autoantibody production in NZB/W mice as a model of lupus nephritis. The aim of this study was to determine the role of autoreactive long-lived (memory) PCs refractory to immunosuppression and B cell depletion in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus.
