The murine chronic GVH (cGVH) model of SLE is induced by allo-recognition of foreign major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II determinants. Previous studies have shown that syngeneic CD4(+) T cells are needed during B cell development in order to induce cGVH response in CD4KO mice. Our present studies show that B cells require "nurturing" by CD4 T cells through much of their ontogeny in order to respond to allo-signaling and become autoreactive. The nurturing process does not require antigen-specific cognate interactions between CD4 T cells and B cells. It is mediated by IL-4, but not IL-10, IL-6 and IFN-gamma. The CD4 T cell nurturing may be supplanted by large doses of IL-4 and/or by agonistic anti-CD40 mAb. Understanding the mechanism of this "nurturing" process may yield clues to the role of CD4 T cells in lupus and in host defense in general.
