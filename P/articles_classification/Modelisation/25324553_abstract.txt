Because of the preponderance of women affected by the chronic autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), estrogen is thought to contribute to SLE disease progression. This is supported by evidence from experimental animal models of SLE showing that removal of estrogen in young female mice delays autoantibody production and renal injury and lengthens survival. Blood pressure and changes in body composition are important cardiovascular risk factors that can be regulated by estrogens. Because cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with SLE, we used an established female mouse model of SLE (NZBWF1) to test whether early life removal of estrogen impacts the development of hypertension and changes in body composition commonly associated with SLE. Eight-week-old female SLE and control mice (NZW/LacJ) underwent either a sham operation or ovariectomy. Body weight, body composition (fat and lean masses), and renal injury (albuminuria) were monitored until mice reached 34 wk of age, at which time mean arterial pressure was assessed in conscious animals by a carotid catheter. Early life removal of the ovaries delayed the onset of autoantibody production and albuminuria while causing an increase in body weight and fat mass. Blood pressure in the adult was not altered by early life removal of the ovaries. These data suggest that estrogens may have a permissive role for the development of SLE while helping to maintain normal body weight and composition, which is associated with reduced cardiovascular risk.
