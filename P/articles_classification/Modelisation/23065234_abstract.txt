The RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) and MBL (mannose binding lectin) single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been repeatedly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but the findings are not consistent across studies. The aim of this study was to determine whether the functional RANTES-28, -403 and MBL2 A/O polymorphisms confer susceptibility to SLE in multiple ethnic populations. A meta-analysis was conducted (allelic contrast, the additive model, the dominant model and the recessive model) on RANTES with seven studies (four studies for RANTES-28: three Asian and one American studies; three studies for RANTES-403: two Asian and one European studies), MBL with eight studies (five European and three American studies). OR is used as a measure of the effect of the association in a fixed/random effects model. The meta-analysis indicated that none of the two polymorphisms in gene of the RANTES showed any significant association with SLE risk, respectively, except for the recessive model (OR = 1.24, 95 % CI: 1.01-1.52, P = 0.04) in all study subjects combined with the two polymorphisms. According to the MBL2 A/O polymorphism, the results indicated a significant association between the polymorphism and SLE in allelic contrast (OR = 0.83, 95 % CI: 0.73-0.93, P = 0.002). While stratified by ethnicity in European, no significant association was found. In summary, the present study suggests that the RANTES-28, -403 polymorphisms do not associate with SLE, but the MBL2 A/O polymorphism might associate with SLE.
